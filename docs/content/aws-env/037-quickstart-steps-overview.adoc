=== Connecting to the Cluster

Once your cluster is running and bootstrapped, ssh into the cluster. 

Go to the Cluster List (“Services” dropdown, select EMR) and click on the cluster you created. You will use the “Master public DNS” 
value as your hostname and the security key you assigned to the cluster to access it. If you are prompted for a login, the default name is "hadoop"

If you are unsure of how to do this, click on the blue SSH link to the right of your Master public DNS to open a popup that will walk you though it.

[NOTE]
====
The cluster status may show as waiting before the bootstrap script has completed. Please allow 5-7 minutes 
for the cluster to be setup and bootstrapped. This may take longer if you are using spot instances.  
====

If you are using Accumulo as your datastore, the script will automatically create a geowave user with a password (geowave) and table creation permissions, as well as pointing accumulo to the geowave jar on hdfs.
