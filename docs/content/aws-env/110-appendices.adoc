=== Create EC2 VPC (Network Interface/Subnet Id)

From the “Services” dropdown, select VPC. Then click on the “Start VPC Wizard” button.

The default VPC setup is VPC with a single public subnet. This is what we will use for the example here, however other VPC
setups will work as well.

You can use the default values for everything in this step and create a useable VPC. We recommend that you add a VPC name and
change the default Subnet name to make them both easier to identify later on.

Click the “Create VPC” button and after a short period of time you will receive a confirmation of your VPC creation.

Click the “Subnets” link on the left side of the page and find your new subnet.

Record the Subnet ID. You will need it if you are using the AWS CLI method to create your cluster.

For a more detailed walkthough of creating an AWS VPC please see the Amazon documentation http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/GettingStartedGuide/getting-started-create-vpc.html[here].

“Create Key Pair” button.

[NOTE]

When you create the key pair Amazon will automatically begin to download your private key. Save this somewhere you will
remember, because you will need it to ssh into your cluster.
