=== Creating the Cluster

Download the bootstrap-geowave.sh script https://s3.amazonaws.com/geowave-guide-bucket/bootstrap-geowave.sh[here] and upload it to your S3 bucket.

*Note:* You can also clone the GeoWave project from https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave[GitHub] and find the script under deploy/emr/4/gdelt-example/

If you have not created an S3 bucket please see the <<110-appendices.adoc#create-aws-s3-bucket, AWS S3 Bucket>> section.

=== AWS CLI Method

This is the basic makeup of the command you will call to create your geowave test cluster. All variables, designated as 
${VARIABLES}, will need to be be replaced with your individual path, group, value, etc. An explanation of each of the 
variables is given below the command.

Once the process of cluster initialization has started you will see the cluster appear in the EMR console immediately.
The GeoWave portion of the process does not occur until the Hadoop and Spark portions of the initializations have completed
which takes approximately 4-5 minutes. Once the GeoWave components have been installed there is an optional volume
initialization step that will read every block of each volume to clear any initialization flags that may have been set.
This option should be used when you want to benchmark an operation but can probably be skipped if you're primarily interested
in quickly setting up a cluster to test some capability.

* ${CLUSTER_NAME} - The name you want to show up in the Cluster list in AWS
** Example: “geowave-guide-cluster”
* ${NUM_WORKERS} - The number core/worker nodes you want
** You will be working with a relatively small amount of data in this walkthrough so we recommend using two
* ${YOUR_KEYNAME} - The name of the key value pair you want to use for this cluster
** Example: geowave-guide-keypair
** If you have not created a keypair for this cluster please follow the steps <<110-appendices.adoc#create-ec2-key-pair, here>>.
* ${YOUR_SUBNET_ID} - The subnet id linked with your security group(s)
** Example: subnet-bc123123
** If you are unsure of which subnet to use please see the VPC (network interface/subnet id) section <<110-appendices.adoc#create-ec2-vpc-network-interface-subnet-id, here>>.
* ${YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP} - This is the security group(s) you want the cluster to be assigned to.
** Example: sg-1a123456
** If your AWS EMR account has default security groups setup you can leave the EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup and EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup out of --ec2-attributes
** If you are unsure of which groups to use here please see the EC2 Security Group section <<110-appendices.adoc#create-ec2-security-group, here>>.

* ${YOUR_TAGNAME} - Tag name for the cluster you are creating
** Example: “geowave-guide”
** The --tags is completely optional, but may help you search for this cluster if there are many on the aws account you are using
* ${YOUR_REGION} - Your aws region
** Example: “us-east-1”

If your create-cluster command was successful it will return the ClusterId of your cluster, otherwise you will receive a 
message  detailing why the command failed.

For more information on the create-cluster command please see the amazon documentation http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr/create-cluster.html[here].

*Note:* The return of a ClusterId only verifies that aws understood your command and has begun setting up the desired 
cluster. There are many things that could still go wrong and cause the cluster to fail. You can open the AWS EMR GUI to 
follow the progress of your cluster’s creation.

The bootstrap-geowave.sh script will now setup the environment, then download and process one month of gdelt data. 

Please view the <<interacting-with-the-cluster,Interacting with the Cluster>> section of this document to see how the data 
can be visualized, or the <<bootstrap-script-breakdown,Bootstrap Script Breakdown>> section to see more detail about what 
is being done by the bootstrap script.

*Note:* The entire process takes approximately 40 minutes on a three node cluster.

*Note:* The entire process takes about 40 minutes on a three node cluster.

=== Interacting with the Cluster

Enable Web Connections

Go to the Cluster List (“Services” dropdown, select EMR) and click on the cluster you created. Use the “Master public DNS” 
value as your hostname and the security key you assigned to the cluster to enable the web connection.

image::interacting-cluster-1.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

If you are unfamiliar how to do this click on the “Enable Web Connection” link for detailed instructions on how to enable the 
web connection for Linux or Windows.

Accumulo Overview

You can follow the progress of the data ingest and scan (kde) performed by the cluster on hte accumulo web server.

Open a new tab in your web browser and enter the Master public DNS of your cluster followed by :50095

* Example: ec2-52-91-215-215.compute-1.amazonaws.com:50095

You should see the following page:

image::interacting-cluster-2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

GeoServer

Open a new tab in your web browser and enter the Master public DNS of your cluster followed by :8000/geoserver/web/

* Example: ec2-52-91-215-215.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/geoserver/web/

image::interacting-cluster-3.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

Log into Geoserver

* Username: admin
* Password: geoserver

image::interacting-cluster-4.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

Once the bootstrap-geowave.sh script is finished you will see two layers have been created. To view them click on the 
“Layer Preview” link under the Data menu on the left side of the page.

image::interacting-cluster-5.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

Click the OpenLayers link for either one to view it in another tab.

* gdeltevent - shows all of the gdelt events in a bounding box around western europe as individual points.

image::interacting-cluster-6.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

* gdeltevent_kde - a heat map produced using kernel density estimation in a bounding box around western europe.

image::interacting-cluster-7.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

=== Bootstrap Script Breakdown

The bootstrap script we are running in this tutorial has a few steps and runs a number of other scripts to setup the 
environment, download the data, ingest the data, run the kde and set up the layers for geoserver. This section gives a 
basic breakdown of each script. All scripts can be found in the geowave project under deploy/emr/4/gdelt-example/ 
directory.

* bootstrap-geowave.sh
** This is the main script and has five major steps:
*** Download and source the other scripts
*** Delays the rest of the script until EMR is done setting up the desired environment
*** Configures zookeeper and accumulo
*** Runs the install_geowave and setup-geowave scripts
*** Initializes all volumes

* geowave-install-lib.sh
** This script is mostly a list of methods that are called by the bootstrap-geowave script. It contains the majority of the 
actual code that will be run.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* geowave-env.sh
** Defines variables (port numbers, timeframe, bounding box, versions, etc.) for the other scripts.

* setup-geowave.sh
** Calls the ingest-and-kde-gdelt and setup-geoserver-geowave-workspace scripts.

* ingest-and-kde-gdelt.sh
** Creates an accumulo user and namespace, downloads the gdelt dataset defined in the geowave-env script, ingests that data, 
and runs a kde on the data. A good script to look though if you want to learn the commands used to perform these actions.

* setup-geoserver-geowave-workspace.sh
** Uses the information in the geoserver-geowave-workspace.tar to setup your geoserver workspace stores and layers. This would 
normally be done by the user through the geoserver interface.

=== Interacting with the Cluster

Enable Web Connections

Go to the Cluster List (“Services” dropdown, select EMR) and click on the cluster you created. Use the “Master public DNS” 
value as your hostname and the security key you assigned to the cluster to enable the web connection.

image::interacting-cluster-1.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

If you are unfamiliar how to do this click on the “Enable Web Connection” link for detailed instructions on how to enable the 
web connection for Linux or Windows.

Accumulo Overview

You can follow the progress of the data ingest and scan (kde) performed by the cluster on hte accumulo web server.

Open a new tab in your web browser and enter the Master public DNS of your cluster followed by :50095

* Example: ec2-52-91-215-215.compute-1.amazonaws.com:50095

You should see the following page:

image::interacting-cluster-2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

GeoServer

Open a new tab in your web browser and enter the Master public DNS of your cluster followed by :8000/geoserver/web/

* Example: ec2-52-91-215-215.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/geoserver/web/

image::interacting-cluster-3.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

Log into Geoserver

* Username: admin
* Password: geoserver

image::interacting-cluster-4.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

Once the bootstrap-geowave.sh script is finished you will see two layers have been created. To view them click on the 
“Layer Preview” link under the Data menu on the left side of the page.

image::interacting-cluster-5.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

Click the OpenLayers link for either one to view it in another tab.

*gdeltevent* - shows all of the gdelt events in a bounding box around western europe as individual points.

image::interacting-cluster-6.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

You may have notices that it took a fair amount of time to render the ~1.5 million points. To speed this process up we 
can set the default style the Decimate Points style that was added in our script and can be found in the geowave 
directory at geowave/examples/example-slds/DecimatePoints.sld. This can be done using the geowave cli commands or via 
the geoserver GUI.

Geowave CLI:

[source, bash]
----
geowave gs setls gdeltevent --styleName DecimatePoints
----

Geoserver GUI:

* Click on the Layers link in the menu at the left side of the page and select the gdeltevent layer
* Select the Publishing tab, open the Default Style dropdown and select DecimatePoints

image::interacting-cluster-8.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="select emr"]

* Click the Save button at the bottom of the page and reopen the image by going back to the Layer Preview and clicking 
the OpenLayers link
* You should see a noticeable difference in the time it takes to render the points

After the cluster has finished initializing you should be able to ssh into the master node and perform the final bits of
project specific GeoWave configuration. The root password for Accumulo is set at the top of the bootstrap-geowave.sh script.
You'd want to log into Accumulo and perform steps listed in the Accumulo Configuration section of the documentation. The
latest iterator built for Apache Hadoop will have been uploaded into HDFS but no user accounts, namespaces or VFS contexts
will have been configured. All of these are described with examples in both the GeoWave and Accumulo documentation.
