=== Adapters

In order to store geometry, attributes, and other information, a format is required that describes how to serialize and deserialize the data.
GeoWave provides an interface that handles the serialization and deserialization of feature data. A default implementation
supporting the GeoTools simple feature type is included by default. More on this specific implementation, as well
as the interface, will be detailed later in this document. A pointer to the java class (expected to be on
the classpath) is stored in the Adapter persistence table. This is loaded dynamically when the data is queried and the
results are translated to the native data type

==== Feature Serialization

GeoWave allows developers to create their own data adapters. Adapters not only determine how the data is actually stored
(serialization/deserialization), but also contain a hierarchy of attribute types. The reason for this hierarchy has to
do with extensibility vs. optimization. A data adapter could theoretically take a dependency on ffmpeg, store the
feature as metadata in a video stream, and persist that value to the database. All questions of sanity of this solution
aside, there are some additional specific issues with the way fine grain filtering is done - specifically due to the
iterators. Iterators are part of the Accumulo extensibility module and allow for arbitrary code to be plugged in directly
at the tablet server level into the core Accumulo kernel. With more code in the iterators there is both a greater chance
of crashing (and taking down a tablet server - and possibly an Accumulo instance), greater use of memory (memory used by
the iterator / class loader isn't available for caching, etc., and a greater O&M debt - the iterators have to be
distributed to each client out of band - and require impersonating the Accumulo user (possibly root).

Based on this, our goal was to minimize the code, and standardize on as few iterators as possible. This conflicted with
the desire to allow maximum flexibility with arbitrary DataAdapters. A middle ground was found, and this hierarchy was
created. Some standardization was put in place around how certain data types would be stored and serialized, but a
"native data" portion was still left in place for arbitrary data - with the caveat that native data cannot be used in
distributed (iterator based) filtering - only in client side filtering.

==== Primary Index Data

These are sets of data which are also used to construct the primary index (space filling curve). They will typically be
geometry coordinates and optionally time - but could be any set of numeric values (think decomposed feature vectors, etc.).
They cannot be null.

==== Common Index Data

These are a collection of attributes. There can be any number of attributes, but they must conform to the DimensionField
interface - the attribute type must have a FieldReader and a FieldWriter that is within the classpath of the tablet
servers. GeoWave provides a basic implementation for these attribute types:

* Boolean
* Byte
* Short
* Float
* Double
* BigDecimal
* Integer
* Long
* BigInteger
* String
* Geometry
* Date
* Calendar

The values that are not part of the primary index can be used for distributed secondary filtering, and can be null.
The values that are associated with the primary index will be used for fine-grained filtering within an iterator.

==== Native Data

These can be literally anything. From the point of view of the data adapter they are just a binary (or Base64) encoded
chunk of data. No distributed filtering can be performed on this data except for Accumulo's visibility filter - but the
client side filtering extensibility point can still be used if necessary. The Data Adapter has to provide methods to
serialize and deserialize these items in the form of Field Readers and Writers, but it is not necessary to have these
methods on the classpath of any nodes.
