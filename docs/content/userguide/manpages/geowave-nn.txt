NAME
//:----

geowave analytic nn - Nearest Neighbors

SYNOPSIS
//:--------

*geowave analytic nn* [options] <storename>

DESCRIPTION
//:-----------

The geowave analytic nn operator will execute a Nearest Neighbors analytic.
Analytic 'nn' is similar to DBScan, with less arguments.
'nn' just dumps all near neighbors for every feature id in a list of pairs.
Most developers will want to extend the framework to add their own extensions.

EXAMPLE
//:-----------

[source, bash]
----
yarn jar geowave-tools.jar analytic nn -emn 2 -emx 6 -pmd 1000 -oop /user/rwgdrummer_out -orc 4 -hdfs localhost:53000 -jobtracker localhost:8032 -hdfsbase /user/rwgdrummer --query.adapters gpxpoint my_store
----

The min hdfs input split is 2 (emn), max hdfs input split is 6 (emx), max search distance is 1000 meters (pmd),
the sequence file output directory is hdfs://host:port/user/rwgdrummer_out, reducer count is 4 (orc), 
the hdfs ipc port is localhost:53000 (hdfs), the yarn job tracker is at localhost:8032 (-jobtracker),
the temporary files needed by this job are stored in hdfs:/host:port//user/rwgdrummer (hdfsbase), and the data executed against is 'gpxpoint' (query.adapters).  
The accumulo connection parameters are loaded from my_store.

EXECUTION
//:-----------

To execute nearest neighbor search in GeoWave, we use the concept of a "partitioner" to 
partition all data on the hilbert curve into square segments for the 
purposes of parallelizing the search.  

The default partitioner will multiply this value by 2 and use that for the actual partition sizes. 
Because of this, the terminology is a bit confusing, but the "pmd" option is actually the most 
important variable here, describing the max distance for a point to be considered a neighbor to
another point.
