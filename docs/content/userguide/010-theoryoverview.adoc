=== Spatial Index

GeoWave creates a spatial index to represent multi-dimensional data in a manner that can be reduced to a series of ranges on a 1 dimensional number line.
Examples of these include:

* latitude, longitude
* latitude, longitude, time
* latitude, longitude, altitude, time
* feature vector1, feature vector 2 (…), feature vector n

This is due to the way big table based databases store the data – as a sorted set of key/value pairs.

The goal is to provide a property that ensures values close in n-dimensional space are still close in 1-dimensional space.
There are a few reasons for this, but primarily it’s so we can represent an n-dimensional range selector (bbox typically
– but can be abstracted to a hyper-rectangle) as a smaller number of highly contiguous 1d ranges.

Fortunately there is already a type of transform that describes this operation in mathematics – it’s called a “Space
Filling Curve” – or SFC for short. Different space filling curves have different properties, but they all take
an n-dimensional space and describe a set of steps to trace all points in a single sequence.

The trade-offs for the various curves are outside the scope of this user manual, but the paper cited for figure two is
an excellent starting point to start learning about these curves.

GeoWave supports two space filling curves: Z-Order and Hilbert, with the Hilbert type space filling curve being the 
primary implementation. 

==== Hilbert SFC

The Hilbert curve is a bit more complex to work with than the Z-curve – both when calculating and when performing a
decomposition. Nevertheless it is popular in certain areas in computer science where multiple variables need to be set 
in a linear order – process scheduling for one. A simplistic view of a standard projections of the earth mapped to 
a Hilbert curve would look something like this – with 4 bits of cardinality per dimension (how many buckets we have).

Note that the cardinality (number of buckets per dimensions) has an impact on the resolution of our Hilbert
index. Here we map from -180 to +180 over 16 buckets – so we have resolution of no better than 360/16, or 22.5 degrees
for longitude (and incidentally 11.25 degrees for latitude). This doesn’t mean we can’t represent values more precisely
than this. It just means that our initial (coarse) index (based on SFC ranges) can’t provide resolution any better than
this. Adding more bits per dimensions will increase the precision of the SFC based index.

==== Z-Order SFC

This is also commonly called a GeoHash, or Morton order (and sometimes incorrectly called a Peano curve). This is the
most popular SFC used for multi-dimensional -> 1-dimensional mappings – primarily because it is very easy to implement 
in code. There are two common ways to implement this. Ideally a bit-interleaving approach is used (that is what gives 
rise to the diagram in the figure _Z-Order curve based dimensional decomposition_). Imagine we had two numbers, A and 
B. Let the binary representation of those numbers be A1A2A3 and B1B2B3. The “bit interleaved” version would be 
A1B1A2B2A3B3. Since we are working with binary numbers this gives a “unit cell” of 2x2. If we added dimensions, just 
imagine the same interleaving, but another term - C1C2C3, etc. This is sometimes implemented in base 10 instead of base 
2. This implementation reduces somewhat the locality (“packing property” – or the measure of how close numbers in 
n-dimensional space are to numbers in 1-dimensional space). As you might expect a two dimensional version of this gives 
a unit cell of 10x10 (for two dimensions) – hence the worse packing.
