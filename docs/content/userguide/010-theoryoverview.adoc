=== Spatial Index

GeoWave creates a spatial index to represent multi-dimensional data in a manner that can be reduced to a series of ranges on a 1 dimensional number line.
Examples of these include:

* latitude, longitude
* latitude, longitude, time
* latitude, longitude, altitude, time
* feature vector1, feature vector 2 (…), feature vector n

This is due to the way big table based databases store the data – as a sorted set of key/value pairs.

The goal is to provide a property that ensures values close in n-dimensional space are still close in 1-dimensional space.
There are a few reasons for this, but primarily it’s so we can represent an n-dimensional range selector (bbox typically
– but can be abstracted to a hyper-rectangle) as a smaller number of highly contiguous 1d ranges.

Fortunately there is already a type of transform that describes this operation in mathematics – it’s called a “Space
Filling Curve” – or SFC for short. Different space filling curves have different properties, but they all take
an n-dimensional space and describe a set of steps to trace all points in a single sequence.

The trade-offs for the various curves are outside the scope of this user manual, but the paper cited for figure two is
an excellent starting point to start learning about these curves.

GeoWave supports two space filling curves: Z-Order and Hilbert, with the Hilbert type space filling curve being the 
primary implementation.
