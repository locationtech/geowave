== Introduction

=== Purpose of this Guide

This user guide focuses on the various ways a user can interact with GeoWave without writing code. It covers the Command-Line Interface (CLI), the ingest process, the vector query language, analytics, visibility management, as well as the GeoServer plugin.

=== Assumptions

This guide assumes that the reader is familiar with the basics of GeoWave discussed in the link:overview.html[Overview]. It also assumes that GeoWave has already been installed and is available on the command-line.  See the link:installation-guide.html[Installation Guide^, window="_blank"] for help with the installation process.

=== External Components

Some commands in this guide are intended to be used alongside external third party components.  The following are *not* required, but the versions supported by GeoWave are listed below. The installation and configuration of these external components is outside the scope of this document.
