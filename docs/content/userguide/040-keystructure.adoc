=== Key Structure

The above diagram describes the default structure of entries in the data store. The index ID comes directly
from the tiered space filling curve implementation. We do not impose a requirement that data IDs are globally unique
but they should be unique for the adapter. Therefore, the pairing of Adapter ID and Data ID define a unique identifier
for a data element. The lengths are stored within the row ID as 4 byte integers. This enables fully reading the row ID
because these IDs can be of variable length. The number of duplicates is stored within the row ID as well to inform the
de-duplication filter whether this element needs to be temporarily stored in order to ensure no duplicates are sent to the caller.
The adapter ID is within the Row ID to enforce unique row IDs as a whole row iterator is used to aggregate fields for the
distributable filters. The adapter ID is also used as the column family as the mechanism for adapter-specific queries to
fetch only the appropriate column families.
