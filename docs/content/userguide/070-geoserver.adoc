=== GeoServer

This section will outline the various aspects of the GeoServer tools that are relevant to GeoWave capabilities. While GeoServer is a third-party tool that integrates with GeoWave, it is important to note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to GeoServer, though it's more of an overview and integration guide. For official GeoServer documentation and how-to guides, please reference the link:http://docs.geoserver.org[GeoServer documentation, window="_blank"] guides.

[NOTE]
====
This section assumes that a GeoWave GeoServer plugin has already been created. If this is not the case and a plugin needs to be created, please refer to the <<080-install-from-source.adoc#geoserver-plugin, GeoServer plugin section>>.
====

GeoWave supports both raster images and vector data exposed through Geoserver.

==== WFS-T

GeoWave supports WFS-T for vector data by extending GeoTools. After following the deployment steps, GeoWave appears as the data store types called <<070-geoserver.adoc#geoserver-accumulo-plugin, 'GeoWave Datastore - ACCUMULO'>> and <<070-geoserver.adoc#geoserver-hbase-plugin, 'GeoWave Datastore - HBASE'>>.
