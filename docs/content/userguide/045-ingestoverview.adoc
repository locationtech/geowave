=== Overview

In addition to the raw data to ingest, the ingest process requires an adapter to translate the native data into a format
that can be persisted into the data store. Also, the ingest process requires an Index which is a definition of all the
configured parameters that define how data is translated to row IDs (how it is indexed) and what common fields need to
be maintained within the table to be used by fine-grained and secondary filters.

The full list of GeoWave ingest commands can be found in the http://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/commands.html#ingest-commands[GeoWave CLI Appendix^].
