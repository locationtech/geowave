=== Decomposition

Range decomposition is core to the concept of SFC based indexing. This is when we take a range described in multiple
dimensions and turn it into a series of 1d ranges.

_Figure: Hilbert Ranges_

In the figure above we show that we mean by this. The bounding box described by the blue selection window – or
(2,9) -> (5,13) will “fully” decompose to 3 ranges – 70->75, 92->99, and 116->121.

It should be noted that sometimes more simplistic algorithms will not fully decompose – but would instead represent
this as 70->121, or even 64->127 (the smallest “unit cell” this box fits in). As you can see, this would result in
scanning many extraneous cells.

At some point, with high precision high dimensionality curves, the number of possible unit cells can become too large
to deal with. In such a case, GeoWave optimizes this by treating the curve as a “lower cardinality” curve than it
actually is. So the unit cell size might not be 1, but instead 64, 128, 1024, etc. This allows the user to still
achieve high precision when selection windows are small, but not spend an inordinate amount of time fully decomposing
for large selection windows.

==== Consider a region query asking for all data from:

---------------
 (1,1) -> (5,4)
---------------

This query range is shown at left by a blue bounding box.

==== What did we do here?

* We broke down the initial region into 4 subregions – Red boxes.
* We broke down each subregion (red box) into 4 sub-sub regions (purple boxes)
* We then broke down each of those purple boxes into green boxes.

[NOTE]
====
* Once we had a decomposed quad which is full contained by the bounding
box we stopped decomposing.
* We didn’t bother decomposing regions which didn’t overlap the original
search criteria.

Here we see the query range fully decomposed into the underlying "quads". Note that in some instances we were able to
stop decomposing when the query window fully contained the quad (segment 3 and segment 8)

Now we have fully transitioned to the 1d number line from the previous set of quads. We have also rolled together
regions which are contiguous.
