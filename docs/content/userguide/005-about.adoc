== Introduction

=== What is GeoWave

GeoWave is an open-source library for storage, index, and search of multi-dimensional data on top of sorted key-value datastores and popular big data frameworks. GeoWave includes specific tailored implementations that have advanced support for OGC spatial types (up to 3 dimensions), and both bounded and unbounded temporal values. Both single and ranged values are supported on all axes. GeoWaveâ€™s geospatial support is built on top of the GeoTools project extensibility model. This means that it can integrate natively with any GeoTools-compatible project, such as GeoServer and UDig, and can ingest GeoTools compatible data sources.

GeoWave provides out-of-the-box support for distributed key/value stores, as necessary for mission needs. The latest version of GeoWave supports link:https://accumulo.apache.org[Apache Accumulo^, window="_blank"] and link:https://hbase.apache.org[Apache HBase^, window="_blank"] stores, though additional data stores can be implemented as requested or needed.

This guide serves the purpose of focusing on the development side of GeoWave capabilities as well as assisting developers with the GeoWave code surroundings.

* GeoWave Capabilities
[options="compact"]
- Add multi-dimensional indexing capability to Apache Accumulo and Apache HBase
- Add support for geographic objects and geospatial operators to Apache Accumulo and Apache HBase
- Provide a link:http://geoserver.org/[GeoServer^, window="_blank"] plugin to allow geospatial data in Accumulo and HBase to be shared and visualized via OGC standard services
- Provide Map-Reduce input and output formats for distributed processing and analysis of geospatial data

* Geospatial software plugins include the following:
[options="compact"]
- link:http://geoserver.org/[GeoServer, window="_blank"] plugin to allow geospatial data in Accumulo to be shared and visualized via OGC standard services
- link:http://www.pdal.io/[PDAL, window="_blank"] plugin for working with point cloud data
- link:http://mapnik.org/[Mapnik, window="_blank"] plugin for generating map tiles and generally making good looking maps.

Basically, GeoWave is working to bridge geospatial software with distributed compute systems and attempting to do for distributed key/value stores what PostGIS does for PostgreSQL.

=== Origin

GeoWave was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with link:http://www.radiantblue.com/[RadiantBlue Technologies^, window="_blank"] and link:http://www.boozallen.com/[Booz Allen Hamilton^, window="_blank"]. The government has link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/NOTICE[unlimited rights^, window="_blank"] and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the link:http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache 2.0^, window="_blank"] license.

=== Intent

==== Pluggable Backend

GeoWave is intended to be a multidimensional indexing layer that can be added on top of any sorted key-value store. Accumulo was chosen as the initial target architecture, and support for HBase has been added as well. Any datastore which allows prefix based range scans should be straightforward extensions.

==== Modular Framework Design

The GeoWave architecture is designed to be extremely extensible with most of the functionality units defined by interfaces, and with default implementations of these interfaces to cover most use cases. GeoWave allows for easy feature extension and platform integration â€“ bridging the gap between distributed technologies and minimizing the learning curve for developers. The intent is that the out of the box functionality should satisfy 90% of use cases, but the modular architecture allows for easy feature extension as well as integration into other platforms.

==== Self-Describing Data

GeoWave stores the information needed to manipulate data, such as configuration and format, in the database itself. This allows software to programmatically interrogate all the data stored in a single or set of GeoWave instances without needing bits of configuration from clients, application servers, or other external stores.

==== Scalable

GeoWave is designed to operate either in a single-node setup or it can scale out as large as needed to support the amount of data and/or processing resources necessary. By utilizing distributed computing clusters and server-side fine grain filtering, GeoWave is fully capable of performing interactive time and/or location specific queries on datasets containing billions of features with 100 percent accuracy.

== Overview
For GeoWave users, the primary method of interfacing with GeoWave is through the various Command-Line Interface (CLI) commands and options. Users will use GeoWave to store, index, or search multi-dimensional data in a key-value datastore.

This _typically_ involves these four steps:
[options="compact"]
* *Configure*
+
Set up/configure a datastore or index on GeoWave for re-use across various operations as needed.
* *Ingest*/*Index*
+
Ingest, or Index, data into a specific store (e.g., Accumulo, HBase)
* *Process*
+
Process data using a distributed processing engine (e.g. MapReduce, Spark)
* *Query*/*Discover*
+
Search/Query or Discover data ingested, indexed, or processed/transformed through GeoWave operations. A common data discovery tool used is link:http://geoserver.org/[GeoServer^, window="_blank"], which interfaces with GeoWave through the plugin, for interfacing with the selected datastore, e.g., Accumulo or HBase.

GeoWave uses tiered, gridded, Space Filling Curves (SFCs) to index data into your desired key-value store. The indexing information is stored in a generic key structure that can also be used for server-side processing. This architecture allows query, processing, and rendering times to be reduced by multiple orders of magnitude.
