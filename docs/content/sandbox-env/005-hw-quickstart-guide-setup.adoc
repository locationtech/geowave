== Setting Up the Environment

The virtual image provided for this demo can be found at http://s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/VirtualBox_HDP_GeoWave_Sandbox.ova[here]. The image is a very large file (~14 GB) so make sure that you give yourself enough time to download it and that your machine has enough room to store it.

=== Setting up the VirtualBox Image

- Open up your VirtualBox manager. If you do not have VirtualBox downloaded, do so link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[here, window="_blank"]. This demo was tested against VirtualBox 5.1.26, you may experience trouble importing the virtual image on older versions.

- Click "File" and select "Import Appliance" from the dropdown.

- Click on the folder icon, and navigate to _VirtualBox_HDP_GeoWave_Sandbox.ova_ (the image that you downloaded).

- Select "Next" and then "Import"
  * This should take a couple of minutes
  
Once the image has been imported, start it up from the manager. Every time you power the machine on it will ask you which version of Linux
it should boot, pick the default/first option.

The machine should power on shortly (this can take a few minutes). After it's powered on you should see the screen below. This is the last
time that you will have to interact directly with the VirtualBox. Make sure that the virtual machine is active for the duration of this demo.

[NOTE]
=======
VirtualBox Mangager has a feature that allows Virtual Machines to be started and operated in headless ( non-Graphical-User-Interface(GUI) ) mode. Since the Sandbox was setup as a non-GUI VM, it is recommended that users' run their GeoWave Sandbox Virtual Machine in headless mode when possible.

To start a VM in headless mode, within the VirtualBox Manager screen, right-click on the Sandbox VM image that was imported, and select _Start_ --> _Headless Start_. The VM status can be monitored through the _Preview_ pane within the dashboard, and once the VM has started, you can configure your machine and interface with the VM as outlined in the steps below.
