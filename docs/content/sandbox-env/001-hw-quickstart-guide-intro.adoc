== Introduction

The Sandbox Quickstart Guide is designed to allow a user to see some of the capabilities of the GeoWave library on a personal computer, even though GeoWave is primarily designed to be used with massive datasets that would require 
a much more powerful machine to process. The Sandbox VirtualBox image provided will allow a user to deploy a single node cluster where they can demo GeoWave on sets of vector and raster data.
