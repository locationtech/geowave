=== Configure Sandbox

Before you can configure the Sandbox, you will need to edit your hosts file to make sure that you can access the sandbox through your browser. You will need root or admin permissions to change these files.

- **Linux:** Add the line `127.0.0.1  sandbox.hortonworks.com` to the `/etc/hosts` file

- **Mac:** Add the line `127.0.0.1  sandbox.hortonworks.com` to the `/private/etc/hosts` file

- **Windows:** Add the line `127.0.0.1  sandbox.hortonworks.com` to the `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` file

[NOTE]
====
Make sure that you save `hosts` as type "all files" and not as a .txt file. That should be how it appears in the /etc/ folder.

After this you should be able to log into the Ambari Server at http://localhost:8080

- **Username:** raj_ops
- **Password:** raj_ops

The Ambari server provides an interface that allows you to control which services you'd like to run in your environment. However, on start-up, the Sandbox automatically runs a number of unnecessary services. 

To best run this demo you should stop: **Oozie, Flume, Ranger, Spark2,** and **Zeppelin Notebook**. To stop a service, select it from the list on the left, click on "Service Actions," and select "Stop" from the dropdown menu.
