=== AWS CLI Method

This is the basic makeup of the command you will call to create your geowave test cluster. All variables, designated as 
${VARIABLES}, will need to be be replaced with your individual path, group, value, etc. An explanation of each of the 
variables is given below the command.

[source, bash]
----
aws emr create-cluster \
--name ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
--instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m3.xlarge InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=${NUM_WORKERS},InstanceType=m3.xlarge \
--ec2-attributes "KeyName=${YOUR_KEYNAME},SubnetId=${YOUR_SUBNET_ID},EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup=${YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP},EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup=${YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP}" \

--bootstrap-actions Path=s3://geowave-downloads/${BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT},Name=Bootstrap_GeoWave \
--tags ${YOUR_TAGNAME} \
--region ${YOUR_REGION} \
----

- ${CLUSTER_NAME} - The name you want to show up in the Cluster list in AWS
 * Example: “geowave-guide-cluster”
- ${NUM_WORKERS} - The number core/worker nodes you want
 * You will be working with the relatively small amount of data in this walkthrough so we recommend using two
- ${YOUR_KEYNAME} - The name of the key value pair you want to use for this cluster
 * Example: geowave-guide-keypair
 * If you have not created a keypair for this cluster please follow the steps <<110-appendices.adoc#create-ec2-key-pair, here>>.
- ${YOUR_SUBNET_ID} - The subnet id linked with your security group(s)
 * Example: subnet-bc123123
 * If you are unsure of which subnet to use please see the VPC (network interface/subnet id) section <<110-appendices.adoc#create-ec2-vpc-network-interface-subnet-id, here>>.
- ${YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP} - This is the security group(s) you want the cluster to be assigned to.
 * Example: sg-1a123456
 * If your AWS EMR account has default security groups setup you can leave the EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup and EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup out of --ec2-attributes
 * If you are unsure of which groups to use here please see the EC2 Security Group section <<110-appendices.adoc#create-ec2-security-group, here>>.
- ${EMR_VERSION} - The version of EMR that you want to use for your cluster
 * Example: emr-5.1.0
 * GeoWave version 0.9.3 suports up to EMR version 5.2.0
- ${BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT} - The datastore based script you have chosen to provision your cluster.
 * Example: bootstrap-geowave-accumulo
- ${YOUR_TAGNAME} - Tag name for the cluster you are creating
 * Example: “geowave-guide”
 * The --tags is completely optional, but may help you search for this cluster if there are many on the aws account you are using
- ${YOUR_REGION} - Your aws region
 * Example: “us-east-1”

If your create-cluster command was successful it will return the ClusterId of your cluster, otherwise you will receive a 
message  detailing why the command failed.

For more information on the create-cluster command please see the amazon documentation http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr/create-cluster.html[here].

[NOTE]
====
The return of a ClusterId only verifies that aws understood your command and has begun setting up the desired 
cluster. There are many things that could still go wrong and cause the cluster to fail. You can open the AWS EMR GUI to 
follow the progress of your cluster’s creation.
====

The bootstrap-geowave.sh script will now setup the environment, then download and process one month of gdelt data. 

Please view the <<interacting-with-the-cluster,Interacting with the Cluster>> section of this document to see how the data 
can be visualized, or the <<bootstrap-script-breakdown,Bootstrap Script Breakdown>> section to see more detail about what 
is being done by the bootstrap script.

[NOTE]
====
The entire process takes approximately 25 minutes on a three node cluster.
