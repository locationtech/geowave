You may have noticed that it took a fair amount of time to render the ~1.5 million points. To speed this process up we 
can set the default style the Subsample Points style that we (or the quickstart version of the bootstrap script) 
downloaded previously. The style can be found in the geowave directory at geowave/examples/example-slds/SubsamplePoints.sld 
and can also be downloaded http://s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/latest/scripts/emr/quickstart/SubsamplePoints.sld[here].

[NOTE]
====
If you haven't added the Subsample Points style into GeoServer yet please see the <<integrate-with-geoserver,Integrate with Geoserver>> section. 
====

This can be done using the geowave cli commands or via the geoserver GUI.

Geowave CLI:

[source, bash]
----
geowave gs setls gdeltevent --styleName SubsamplePoints
----

Geoserver GUI:

- Click on the Layers link in the menu at the left side of the page and select the gdeltevent layer
- Select the Publishing tab, open the Default Style dropdown and select SubsamplePoints

- Click the Save button at the bottom of the page and reopen the image by going back to the Layer Preview and clicking 
the OpenLayers link
- You should see a noticeable difference in the time it takes to render the points
