= GeoWave Quickstart Guide image:geowave-icon-logo-cropped.png[width="28%"]

The GeoWave quickstart guide is designed to allow a new user to walkthrough a simple use case using the tools built 
into the GeoWave framework. We currently have both a vector and raster walkthough which can be run in and AWS EMR environment 
or on your local machine in a single node sandbox using VirtualBox. There are also Jupyter and Zeppelin Notebook examples for users 
looking try out GeoWave in that manner.
