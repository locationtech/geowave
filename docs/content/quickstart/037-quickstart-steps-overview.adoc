== Running The Steps

=== Connecting to the Cluster

Once your cluster is running and bootstrapped, ssh into the cluster. 

Go to the Cluster List (“Services” dropdown, select EMR) and click on the cluster you created. You will use the “Master public DNS” 
value as your hostname and the security key you assigned to the cluster to access it. 

If you are unsure of how to do this, click on the blue SSH link to the right of your Master public DNS to open a popup that will walk you though it.

[NOTE]
====
The cluster status may show as waiting before the bootstrap script has completed. Please allow 5-7 minutes 
for the cluster to bet setup and bootstrapped. This may take longer if you are using spot instances.

=== Download and Source Files

Next you will need to download a few files that we will use later in this guide. 

[source, bash]
----
cd /mnt <1>
sudo wget s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/latest/scripts/emr/quickstart/geowave-env.sh
sudo wget s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/latest/scripts/emr/quickstart/KDEColorMap.sld
sudo wget s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/latest/scripts/emr/quickstart/SubsamplePoints.sld
----
<1> It is recommended to use the mnt directory for this guide.

The geowave-env.sh script has a number of predefined variables that we will use in the other commands, so we will source it here.

[source, bash]
----
source /mnt/geowave-env.sh
