- <<110-appendices.adoc#aws-cli-setup, AWS CLI>> setup on your local machine (optional)
 * Not needed if you plan on using the EMR GUI to create the cluster

== Creating the Cluster

We will be using the GeoWave bootstrap script to provision our cluster. Then we will walk through the cli commands 
to download, ingest, analyze and visualize the data.

GeoWave currently supports the use of either Accumulo or HBase, so the version of the bootstrap script you 
use will be dependent upon which system you want to use as your datastore.

- For Accumulo use: s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/latest/scripts/emr/accumulo/bootstrap-geowave.sh
- For HBase use: s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/latest/scripts/emr/hbase/bootstrap-geowave.sh

[NOTE]
====
We have also provided scripts that will perform all of the steps automatically. This will allow you to verify your 
own steps, or test out other geowave commands and features on an already conditioned data set.

If you would prefer to have all of the steps run automatically, please use these bootstrap scripts instead of the 
ones listed previously:

- For Accumulo use: s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/latest/scripts/emr/quickstart/accumulo/bootstrap-geowave.sh
- For HBase use: s3.amazonaws.com/geowave/latest/scripts/emr/quickstart/hbase/bootstrap-geowave.sh
