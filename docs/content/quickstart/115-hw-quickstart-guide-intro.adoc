== Introduction

The HortonWorks Sandbox Quickstart Guide is designed to allow a user to see some of the capabilities of the GeoWave library on a personal computer, even though GeoWave is primarily designed to be used with massive datasets that would require 
a much more powerful machine to process. The HortonWorks Sandbox VirtualBox image provided will allow a user to deploy a single node cluster where they can demo GeoWave on sets of vector and raster data. Further information on Geowave and the commands
that will be called in this demo can be found in the <<250-quickstart-guide-further-documentation.adoc#further-documentation, Further Documentation>> section.
