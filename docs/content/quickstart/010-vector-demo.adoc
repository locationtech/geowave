== Vector Demo

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before starting the vector demo, make sure that your working directory is the current active directory in your command-line tool.
====

=== Configure GeoWave Data Store

For this quickstart guide, we will be using RocksDB as the key/value store backend for GeoWave.  This is mainly for simplicity, as RocksDB does not require any external services to be made available.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave store add -t rocksdb --gwNamespace geowave.gdelt --dir . gdelt
----

This command adds a connection to a RocksDB data store in the current directory under the name `gdelt` for use in future commands.  It configures the connection to put all data for this named store under the `geowave.gdelt` namespace.  Although the database does not yet exist, GeoWave will create a new RocksDB database using this configuration.

=== Add an Index

Before ingesting any data, we need to create an index that describes how the data will be stored in the key/value store.  For this example we will create a simple spatial index.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave index add -t spatial gdelt gdelt-spatial
----

This command adds a spatial index to the `gdelt` data store with an index name of `gdelt-spatial`.  This is the name that we will use to reference this index in future commands.

=== Ingest Data

GeoWave has many commands that facilitate ingesting data into a GeoWave data store.  For this example, we want to ingest GDELT data from the local file system, so we will use the link:commands.html#ingest-localToGW[`ingest localToGW`] command.  We will use a bounding box that roughly surrounds Germany to limit the amount of data ingested for the example.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave ingest localToGW -f gdelt --gdelt.cql "BBOX(geometry,5.87,47.2,15.04,54.95)" ./gdelt_data gdelt gdelt-spatial
----

This command specifies the input format as GDELT using the `-f` option, filters the input data using a CQL bounding box filter, and specifies the input directory for all of the files.  Finally, we tell GeoWave to ingest the data to the `gdelt-spatial` index in the `gdelt` data store.  GeoWave creates an adapter for the new data with the type name `gdeltevent`, which we can use to refer to this data in other commands. The ingest should take about 3-5 minutes.

=== Query the Data

Now that the data has been ingested, we can make queries against it.  The GeoWave programmatic API provides a large array of options for issuing queries, but for the purposes of this guide, we will use the query language support that is available for vector data.  This query language provides a simple way to perform some of the most common types of queries using a well-known syntax.  To demonstrate this, perform the following query:

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave vector query "SELECT * FROM gdelt.gdeltevent LIMIT 10"
----

This command tells GeoWave to select all attributes from the `gdeltevent` type in the `gdelt` data store, but limits the output to 10 features.  After running this command, you should get a result that is similar to the following:

----

We can see right away that these results are tagged with the country code `EZ` which falls under Czech Republic.  Since our area of interest is around Germany, perhaps we want to only see events that are tagged with the `GM` country code.  We can do this by adding a CQL filter to the query.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave vector query "SELECT * FROM gdelt.gdeltevent WHERE CQL(countryCode='GM') LIMIT 10"
----

Now the results show only events that have the `GM` country code.

----

If we wanted to see how many events belong to to the `GM` country code, we can perform an aggregation query.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave vector query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gdelt.gdeltevent WHERE CQL(countryCode='GM')"
----

[literal%nowrap]
----
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
| 81897    |
+----------+
----

We can also perform multiple aggregations on the same data in a single query. The following query counts the number of entries that have set `actor1Name` and how many have set `actor2Name`.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave vector query "SELECT COUNT(actor1Name), COUNT(actor2Name) FROM gdelt.gdeltevent"
----

[literal%nowrap]
----
+-------------------+-------------------+
| COUNT(actor1Name) | COUNT(actor2Name) |
+-------------------+-------------------+
| 93750             | 80608             |
+-------------------+-------------------+
----

We can also do bounding box aggregations.  For example, if we wanted to see the bounding box of all the data that has `HUNGARY` set as the `actor1Name`, we could do the following:

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave vector query "SELECT BBOX(*), COUNT(*) AS total_events FROM gdelt.gdeltevent WHERE CQL(actor1Name='HUNGARY')"
----

[literal%nowrap]
----
+------------------------------------------+--------------+
| BBOX(*)                                  | total_events |
+------------------------------------------+--------------+
| Env[6.1667 : 14.7174, 47.3333 : 53.5667] | 408          |
+------------------------------------------+--------------+
----

[NOTE]
====
In these examples each query was output to console, but there are options on the command that allow the query results to be output to several formats, including geojson, shapefile, and CSV.
====

For more information about vector queries, see the link:userguide.html#vector-queries[vector queries, window="_blank"] section of the User Guide.

=== Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

We can also perform analytics on data that has been ingested into GeoWave.  In this example, we will perform the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) analytic.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave analytic kdespark --featureType gdeltevent -m local --minLevel 5 --maxLevel 26 --coverageName gdeltevent_kde gdelt gdelt
----

This command tells GeoWave to perform a Kernel Density Estimation using a local spark cluster on the `gdeltevent` type.  It specifies that the KDE should be run at zoom levels 5-26 and that the new raster generated should be under the type name `gdeltevent_kde`.  Finally, it specifies the input and output data store as our `gdelt` store.  It is possible to output the results of the KDE to a different data store, but for this demo, we will use the same one. The KDE can take 5-10 minutes to complete due to the size of the dataset.

=== Visualizing the Data

Now that we have prepared our vector and KDE data, we can visualize it by using the GeoServer plugin.  GeoWave provides an embedded GeoServer with the command-line tools.

==== Run GeoServer

[IMPORTANT]
====
Execute the following command in a _new_ terminal window.
====

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave gs run
----

After a few moments, GeoServer should be available by browsing to link:localhost:8080/geoserver/web/[localhost:8080/geoserver^, window="blank"].  The login credentials for this embedded service are username `admin` and password `geoserver`. The server will remain running until the command-line process is exited.  You can exit the process by pressing Ctrl+C or by closing the terminal window.

[NOTE]
====
RocksDB only supports a single connection to the database, because of this, you will be unable to perform queries or other data store operations with the CLI while GeoServer maintains a connection to it. If you would like the capability to do both simultaneously, you can use one of the other link:commands.html#standalone-commands[standalone data stores, window="blank"] that are packaged with GeoWave.
====

==== Add Layers

GeoWave provides commands that make adding layers to a GeoServer instance a simple process.  In this example, we can add both the `gdeltevent` and `gdeltevent_kde` types to GeoServer with a single command.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave gs layer add gdelt --add all
----

This command tells GeoWave to add all raster and vector types from the `gdelt` data store to GeoServer.

==== Add Styles

We already downloaded the styles that we want to use to visualize our data as part of the preparation step. The KDEColorMap style will be used for the heatmap produced by the KDE analytic. The SubsamplePoints style will be used to efficiently render the points from the `gdeltevent` type. All we need to do is add them to GeoServer.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave gs style add kdecolormap -sld KDEColorMap.sld
$ geowave gs style add SubsamplePoints -sld SubsamplePoints.sld
----

Now we can update our layers to use these styles.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave gs style set gdeltevent_kde --styleName kdecolormap
$ geowave gs style set gdeltevent --styleName SubsamplePoints
----

==== View the Layers

The GeoServer web interface can be accessed in your browser:

- link:localhost:8080/geoserver/web/[localhost:8080/geoserver^, window="blank"]

Login to see the layers.

- **Username:** admin

- **Password:** geoserver

.GeoServer Homepage
