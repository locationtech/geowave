= GeoWave Standalone Installer 

== Introduction

The Standalone Installer is designed to allow a user to run end-to-end tests of the GeoWave capabilities on a personal computer.  GeoWave's primary strength is with massive datasets that would typically require a distributed cluster of computers.  While GeoWave supports a number of key/value data stores, the installer only bundles embedded versions of Redis, RocksDB, Apache HBase(TM) and Apache Accumulo(TM).

The Standalone installer uses https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html[Install4J] to build multi-platform installers.  Installation requires ~900Mb of disk space and 8Gb of memory.

After you have successfully installed GeoWave, you can proceed to the walkthough demos.

== Running the Embedded Stores
Before diving into the demo links, you will need to start up the store of your choosing.

. Redis
+
[source, bash]
----
geowave util redis run -m 2048M
----
. RocksDB
+
[NOTE]
====
RocksDB is file based and does not run as a service
====
. HBase

**If you are running on a Windows OS**, then you will need to setup Hadoop for the Windows.

.. Download Hadoop binaries for Windows https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils/tree/master/hadoop-2.8.3/bin
.. Set HADOOP_HOME as a global environment variable and add the bin to your Path (%HADOOP_HOME%\bin)

+
[source, bash]
----
geowave util hbase run
----
. Accumulo
+
[source, bash]
----
geowave util accumulo run
----
