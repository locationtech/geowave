=== Indexes

The core engine to quickly retrieve data from GeoWave is a SFC (space filling curve) based index. This index can be
configured with several different parameters:

* number of levels
* number of dimensions
* cardinality of each dimension
* dimension type (bounded / unbounded)
* value range of each dimension

More on each of these properties will be described later; the intent of this list is to provide a notion of what
type of configuration information is persisted.

TODO: Provide a link in the text above to the section where we describe more on these properties.

In order to insert data in a datastore the configuration of the index has to be known. The index is persisted in a
special table and is referenced back via table name to a table with data in it. Therefore queries can retrieve data
without requiring index configuration. There is a restriction that only one index configuration per table is supported -
i.e. you can't store data on both a 2D and 3D index in the same table. (You could store 2D geometry types in a 3D index
though).
