== Screenshots

The screenshots below are of data loaded from the various attributed data sets into a Geowave instance, processed
(in some cases) by a Geowave analytic process, and rendered by Geoserver.

=== GeoLife

Microsoft research has made available a trajectory data set that contains the GPS coordinates of 182 users over a three
year period (April 2007 to August 2012). There are 17,621 trajectories in this data set.

More information on this data set is available at http://research.microsoft.com/jump/131675[Microsoft Research GeoLife page^]

==== GeoLife at city scale

Below are renderings of GeoLife data. They display both the raw points, as well as the results of a GeoWave kernel
density analytic. The data corresponds to Mapbox zoom level 13.

=== OpenStreetMap GPX Tracks

The OpenStreetMap Foundation has released a large set of user contributed GPS tracks.  These are about 8 years of
historical tracks. The data set consists of just under 3 billion (not trillion as some websites claim) point, or
just under one million trajectories.

More information on this data set is available at http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.gpx[GPX Planet page^]

==== OSM GPX at continent scale

The data below corresponds to a Mapbox zoom level of 6

==== OSM GPX at world scale

This data set corresponds to a Mapbox zoom level of 3

=== T-Drive

Microsoft research has made available a trajectory data set that contains the GPS coordinates of 10,357 taxis in
Beijing, China and surrounding areas over  a one week period. There are approximately 15 million points in this data set.

More information on this data set is available at: http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=152883[Microsoft Research T-drive page^]

==== T-drive at city scale

Below are renderings of the t-drive data. They display both the raw points, as well as the results of a Geowave kernel
density analytic. The data corresponds to Mapbox zoom level 12.
