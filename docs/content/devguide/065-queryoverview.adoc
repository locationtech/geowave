== Query
A query in GeoWave currently consists of a set of ranges on the dimensions of the primary index. Up to three dimensions (plus temporal optionally) can take advantage of any complex OGC geometry for the query window. For dimensions of four or greater, the query can only be a set of ranges on each dimension (e.g., hyper-rectangle, etc.).

The query geometry is decomposed by GeoWave into a series of ranges on a one-dimensional number line based on a compact Hilbert space filling curve ordering. These ranges are sent through a batch scanner to all the tablet servers. These ranges represent the coarse grain filtering.

At the same time, the query geometry has been serialized and sent to custom iterators. These iterators then do a second stage filtering on each feature for an exact intersection test. Only if the stored geometry and the query geometry intersect does the processing chain continue.

A second order filter can then be applied. This is used to remove features based on additional attributes - typically time or other feature attributes. These operators can only exclude items from the set defined by the range, not any additional features â€” think "AND" operators - not "OR".

A final filter is possible on the client set, after all the returned results have been aggregated together. Currently, this is only used for final de-duplication. Whenever possible, the distributed filter options should be used, as it splits the work load among all the tablet servers.
