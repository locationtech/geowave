== Statistics

Adapters provide a set of statistics stored within a statistic store.  The set of available statistics is specific to each adapter and
the set of attributes for those data items managed by the adapter. Statistics include:

* Ranges over an attribute, including time.
* Enveloping bounding box over all geometries.
* Cardinality of the number of stored items.
* Histograms over the range of values for an attribute.
* Cardinality of discrete values of an attribute.

Statistics are updated during data ingest and deletion.  Range and bounding box statistics reflect the largest range over time.
Those statistics are not updated during deletion. Statistics based on cardinality are updated upon deletion.

Re-computation of statistics is required in three circumstances:

. As indexed items are removed from the adapter store, the range and envelope statistics may lose their accuracy if the removed item
contains an attribute that represents the minimum or maximum value for the population.
. New statistics added to the statistics store after data items are ingested.  These new statistics do not reflect the entire population.
. Software changes invalidate prior stored images of statistics.

Statistics retain the same visibility constraints as the associated attributes.  Thus, there is a set of statistics for each unique constraint.
The statistics store answers each statistics inquiry for a given adapter with only those statistics matching the authorizations of the requester.
The statistics store merges authorized statistics covering the same attribute.
