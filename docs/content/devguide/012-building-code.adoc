=== Building the Source

==== Tools Framework Overview

A plugin framework (using Service Provider Interface (SPI)-based injection) is provided with several input formats and utilities supported out of the box.
First, we’ll show how to build and use the built-in formats and then describe how to create a new plugin.

==== Building

GeoWave will shortly be available in Maven central (for tagged releases) but until then, or to get the latest features, building GeoWave from source is the best bet.


[[building]]
===== Building GeoWave
To build the project source, navigate to the directory into which the GeoWave code was downloaded. Using Maven from the command line, run the following command in a local terminal:

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn clean install <1>
----
<1> You can speed up the build by skipping tests by adding -Dfindbugs.skip=true -Dformatter.skip=true -DskipITs=true -DskipTests=true

[NOTE]
====
Integration Tests: Windows

Integration tests are currently not working on Windows out of the box. If you install cygwin and set the environmental variable CYGPATH to the location of the cygpath binary provided by cygwin to make it work.
====

Upon executing the command above, you should see a terminal output beginning with similar code below. Maven will build all the projects in the repository, so this will take a few minutes to complete.

Once this is completed, the compiled artifacts (jar, war, etc.) are “installed” into your local repository for each respective project. The compiled artifacts are also available in each project target directory.

==== Maven dependencies

Required repositories not in Maven Central have been added to the parent POM, specifically the cloudera and opengeo repositories.

==== Docker Build Process

We have support for building both the GeoWave jar artifacts and RPMs from Docker containers. This capability is useful for a number of different situations:

* Jenkins build workers can run Docker on a variety of host-operating systems and build for others
* Anyone running Docker will be able to duplicate our build and packaging environments
* Will allow us to build on existing container clusters instead of single purpose build VMs

If building artifacts using Docker containers interests you, check out the README in link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/tree/master/deploy/packaging/docker[`deploy/packaging/docker`, window="_blank"].


=== Creating Eclipse Projects

In order to facilitate a more complete development environment, we now need to get the GeoWave source code into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This section will walk you through how to import Maven projects into the Eclipse IDE.

[NOTE]
====
There are several IDEs available, though this guide will assume use of Eclipse. If you are developing in a different IDE than Eclipse, there are likely guides on the internet to guide you through converting a Maven project into your IDE.
====

Using the link:http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/[Eclipse Maven M2Eclipse plugin, window="_blank"], we can import maven projects into eclipse, and eclipse will automatically resolve/download dependencies listed in the pom.xml file for each project.

[NOTE]
====
If any project pom.xml dependencies are changed/updated, Eclipse will automatically update the project and any downstream changes to related/depependent projects.

. Import the Maven GeoWave projects into the Eclipse workspace.

.. Within Eclipse, select File -> Import.

.. From the "Import" window, select the option under "Maven" for "Existing Maven Projects" and select the "Next" button.

.. From the "Import Maven Projects" window, select the “Browse” button and navigate to the root directory where the GeoWave source is located on the file system. Once found, select the _geowave_ directory and select the "Open" button.
.. Within the "Import Maven Projects" window, the “Projects” pane should now be populated with all of the GeoWave projects. Select the "Finish" button to exit.
.. Upon returning to the workspace in Eclipse, the _Project Explorer_ pane should now be populated with all of the GeoWave projects.
