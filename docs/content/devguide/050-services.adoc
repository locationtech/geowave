=== gRPC 

:linkattrs:

GeoWave's gRPC service provides a way for remote gRPC client applications to interact with GeoWave.

==== gRPC Protobuf

During the build process, GeoWave auto-generates protobuf message files (`.proto`) for all GeoWave commands that derive from the abstract class {core-cli}/core/cli/api/ServiceEnabledCommand.java[`ServiceEnabledCommand`]. The source for the generation process may be found in the  `geowave-grpc-protobuf-generator` project. The auto-generated protobuf files, as well as any manually-generated GeoWave protobuf files can be located in the `geowave-grpc-protobuf` project. The protobuf files are compiled to their respective Java classes by this project as well. For more details on protobuf, please refer to the link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Protocol Buffers tutorials, window="_blank"].

==== gRPC server

The gRPC server discovers and loads all GeoWave gRPC service implementations via the {grpc-server}/service/grpc/GeoWaveGrpcServiceSpi.java[`GeoWaveGrpcServiceSpi`] interface. The server code and gRPC service implementations may be found in the `geowave-grpc-server` project. This project also contains definitions for a few CLI commands to start and stop the server.
