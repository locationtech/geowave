:linkattrs:

GeoWave's gRPC service provides a way for remote gRPC client applications to interact with GeoWave.

==== gRPC Protobuf

During the build process, GeoWave auto-generates protobuf message files (.proto) for all GeoWave commands that derive from the abstract class ServiceEnabledCommand. The source for the generation process may be found in the  geowave-grpc-protobuf-generator project. The auto-generated protobuf files, as well as any manually-generated GeoWave protobuf files can be located in the geowave-grpc-protobuf project. The protobuf files are compiled to their respective Java classes by this project as well. For more details on protobuf, please refer to the link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Protocol Buffers tutorials, window="_blank"] 

==== gRPC server

The gRPC server discovers and loads all GeoWave gRPC service implementations via the GeoWaveGrpcServiceSpi interface. The server code and gRPC service implementations may be found in the geowave-grpc-server project. This project also contains definitions for a few CLI commands to start and stop the server.
