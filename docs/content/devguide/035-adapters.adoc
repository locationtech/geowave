=== Adapters

:linkattrs:

In order to store geometry, attributes, and other information, a format is required that describes how to serialize and deserialize the data. GeoWave provides an interface that handles the serialization and deserialization of feature data. A default implementation supporting the GeoTools simple feature type is included by default. More on this specific implementation, as well as the interface, will be detailed later in this document. A pointer to the Java class, expected to be on the classpath, is stored in the Adapter persistence table. This is loaded dynamically when the data is queried and the results are translated to the native data type.


==== Feature Serialization

image::serialization1.png[scaledwidth="75%",width="75%",alt="Feature Serialization", title="Feature Serialization"]

GeoWave allows developers to create their own data adapters. Adapters not only determine how the data is actually stored (serialization/deserialization), but also contain a hierarchy of attribute types. The reason for this hierarchy has to do with extensibility vs. optimization. A data adapter could theoretically take a dependency on ffmpeg, store the feature as metadata in a video stream, and persist that value to the database. All questions of sanity of this solution aside, there are some additional specific issues with the way fine grain filtering is done, specifically due to the iterators.

Based on this, our goal was to minimize the code and standardize on as few iterators as possible. This conflicted with the desire to allow maximum flexibility with arbitrary DataAdapters. A middle ground was found and this hierarchy was created. Some standardization was put in place around how certain data types would be stored and serialized, but a "native data" portion was still left in place for arbitrary data. The caveat is that native data cannot be used in distributed (iterator based) filtering - only in client side filtering.

==== Primary Index Data

These are sets of data that are also used to construct the primary index SFC. They will typically be geometry coordinates and optionally time, but could be any set of numeric values (think decomposed feature vectors, etc.). They cannot be null.

==== Common Index Data

These are a collection of attributes. There can be any number of attributes but they must conform to the link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/core/store/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/store/dimension/NumericDimensionField.java[NumericDimensionField, window="_blank"] interface. The attribute type must have a link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/core/store/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/store/data/field/FieldReader.java[FieldReader, window="_blank"] and a link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/core/store/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/store/data/field/FieldWriter.java[FieldWriter, window="_blank"] that is within the classpath of the tablet servers. GeoWave provides a basic implementation for these attribute types:

[frame="topbot"]
|=======
| Boolean | Byte       | Short  | Float    | Double | BigDecimal | Integer
| Long    | BigInteger | String | Geometry | Date   | Calendar   |
|=======

The values that are not part of the primary index can be used for distributed secondary filtering and can be null. The values that are associated with the primary index will be used for fine-grained filtering within an iterator.

==== Native Data

These can be literally anything. No distributed filtering can be performed on this data except for Accumulo's visibility filter, but the client-side filtering extensibility point can still be used if necessary. The Data Adapter has to provide methods to serialize and deserialize these items in the form of Field Readers and Writers, but it is not necessary to have these methods on the classpath of any nodes.

==== Field Writers/Readers

These are type specific implementations used by mil.nga.giat.geowave.core.store.adapter.DataAdapter to tell GeoWave how to serialize or deserialize information of a certain type. The default implementations are included in the distributed filter iterators. This is what drives the type requirements listed above in the Common Index Data section.

==== Writing Data

When writing data, writing implementation classes should implement the link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.6.1/api/org/apache/hadoop/io/Writable.html[Writable, window="_blank"] interface.

.Writing Vector Data
When writing vector data, GeoWave provides the default vector writable implementation, the link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/extensions/adapters/vector/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/adapter/vector/FeatureWritable.java[mil.nga.giat.geowave.adapter.vector.FeatureWritable, window="_blank"] class.

This class is used by link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/extensions/adapters/vector/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/adapter/vector/FeatureDataAdapter.java[mil.nga.giat.geowave.adapter.vector.FeatureDataAdapter, window="_blank"] to persist link:http://docs.geotools.org/stable/javadocs/org/opengis/feature/simple/SimpleFeature.html[org.opengis.feature.simple.SimpleFeature, window="_blank"] and its link:http://docs.geotools.org/stable/javadocs/org/opengis/feature/simple/SimpleFeatureType.html[org.opengis.feature.simple.SimpleFeatureType, window="_blank"]. The attribute types of the feature must be understood before the feature can be deserialized so therefore each link:http://docs.geotools.org/stable/javadocs/org/opengis/feature/simple/SimpleFeature.html[org.opengis.feature.simple.SimpleFeature, window="_blank"] serializes its type.

[NOTE]
====
This class caches feature type information. If the feature type changes, then the cache should be emptied using the clearCache() method.

.Writing Raster Data
When writing raster data, GeoWave provides the default raster writable implementation, the link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/extensions/adapters/raster/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/adapter/raster/adapter/GridCoverageWritable.java[mil.nga.giat.geowave.adapter.raster.adapter.GridCoverageWritable, window="_blank"] class.

This class is used by GridCoverageDataAdapter, e.g., link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/extensions/adapters/raster/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/adapter/raster/adapter/RasterDataAdapter.java[mil.nga.giat.geowave.adapter.raster.adapter.RasterDataAdapter, window="_blank"], to persist link:http://docs.geotools.org/stable/javadocs/org/opengis/coverage/grid/GridCoverage.html[org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage, window="_blank"]. The adapter has information regarding the sample model and color model so all that is necessary to persist is the buffer and the envelope.
