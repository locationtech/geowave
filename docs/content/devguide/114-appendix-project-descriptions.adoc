|==========================
5.1+| Path                   | Name                                  | Description

2.1+| 3.1+| geotime          | GeoWave Spatial and Temporal Support  | Builds on the core store and index modules special casing the multidimensional index problem as spatial and spatial-temporal index on a sorted key value store
2.1+| 3.1+| index            | GeoWave Index                         | Focused on the problem of maintaining good lexicographic sort order for multidimensional data, exposed primarily through NumericIndexStrategy, i.e., how do I form my key in the key-value store

1.1+| 4.1+| examples         | GeoWave Examples                      | Some very basic code examples for reading and writing vector data in GeoWave, and running some basic analytics. This is a great and simple place to contribute if you see a gap that you think should be covered.

1.1+| 4.1+| extensions       | GeoWave Extensions                    | The set of extended capabilities supported for GeoWave
2.1+| 3.1+| adapters         | GeoWave Extension Adapaters           | A DataAdapter in the system is essentially responsible for taking any java object and handling serialization/deserialization to/from the value portion of the key-value pair. It's called _encode_ and _decode_ in the code because it is a little more complex than just _serialization_ and _deserialization-, but in general, the over-simplified high-level view is that the link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/core/index/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/index/NumericIndexStrategy.java[NumericIndexStrategy, window="_blank"] from geowave-core-index handles building a good key, and the link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/core/store/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/store/adapter/DataAdapter.java[DataAdapter, window="_blank"] handles building a good value, then the link:https://github.com/locationtech/geowave/blob/master/core/store/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/store/DataStore.java[DataStore, window="_blank"] has no direct logic for mapping the java object to a key or a value. If you have a new java object, you can write a new adapter independent of specific datastores. Likewise, if you have a new strategy for indexing or a different dimensionality to index, that would be independent of any of the specific datastores (ie. you can simply write your own adapter if you have a unique dataset and it can store your data with any indexing scheme on any backend datastore).
3.1+| 2.1+| auth             |                                       | Authorization functionality for GeoWave Data Adapters

2.1+| 3.1+| formats          | GeoWave Extension Formats             | A format plugin in the system is an extension to the commandline ingest framework, providing a means to read data from a particular format of interest and map it to a particular adapter; in the open source project, we provide a variety of vector formats and a single raster format that wraps a popular library; GeoTools ("geotools-vector" format covers all formats supported by GeoTools and geotools-raster covers all raster formats supported by geotools, each covering a large variety of popular geospatial formats)

Integration tests for end-to-end functionality with local test environments for each datastore (often can serve as examples as well, but typically the intent of examples is to be simple and straightforward; the integration tests are more complex, but certainly more inclusive of a variety of functionality)
