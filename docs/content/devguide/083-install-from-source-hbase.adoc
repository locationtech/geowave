=== HBase Plugin

This section will outline how to generate an hbase plugin jar, that can be deployed and run on either a single node or an operational and distributed cluster for interacting with HBase within GeoWave.

[[hbase-versions]]
==== HBase Versions

GeoWave has been tested and worked against HBase 1.2.1 and forward.

[[create-hbase-plugin]]
==== Create HBase Plugin

From the GeoWave root directory, run the following command to create the hbase plugin:

[source, bash]
----
mvn package -P hbase-container-singlejar <1>

----
<1> You can speed up the build by skipping tests by appending to the command: "-Dfindbugs.skip=true -Dformatter.skip=true -DskipITs=true -DskipTests=true" (no quotes).

Once the above command is successfully run, the hbase plugin jar file can be found within the 'deploy/target/' directory.
