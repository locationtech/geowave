=== Packaging the Source

This section is intended to outline how to package the various GeoWave builds into deployable jar files.

[[packaging-tools]]
==== Packaging CLI Tools Framework

When the GeoWave code is ready for packaging and deployment, the code can be easily packaged up using Maven by running the command below from the GeoWave home directory:

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn package -P geowave-tools-singlejar <1>
----
<1> You can speed up the build by skipping tests by adding -Dfindbugs.skip=true -Dformatter.skip=true -DskipITs=true -DskipTests=true

This process will take a minute or two to build.

Once the packaging process has completed, the _geowave-tools_ jar is now packaged in the deploy/target directory.

When packaged for installation, there will be a wrapper alias command named 'geowave' that will be installed in $PATH.

In a development environment where this script has not been installed, a directory containing the tools jar can be created with any needed plugin jars and used with something like the following command:

[source, bash]
----
java -cp "$DIR/* <operation> <options>
----
Alternatively, if operating in an *nix-based environment, adding the command as an alias to the user profile can be performed by following these steps:

. Open the user account profile script for editing.
+
[source, bash]
----
$ vi ~/.profile         [Press Enter]
----

. Add an alias to the profile for geowave. The alias will be structured similar to that below.
+
[source]
----
alias geowave="java -cp $GEOWAVE_HOME/deploy/target/geowave-deploy-${project.version}-tools.jar mil.nga.giat.geowave.core.cli.GeoWaveMain"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Replace $GEOWAVE_HOME with the value of the GeoWave home directory or create an environment variable for that name and value.
====

. Save and close editor.
+
[source]
----
:q!                     [Press Enter]
----

. Update profile in current environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
$ source ~/.profile     [Press Enter]
----

At this point, you can now run GeoWave Command Line Instructions. For a full list of these commands, please see the link:commands.html[GeoWave CLI Appendix, window="_blank"].
