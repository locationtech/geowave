== What is GeoWave

GeoWave is a library for storage, index, and search of multi-dimensional data on top of a sorted key-value datastore.
GeoWave includes specific tailored implementations that have advanced support for OGC spatial types (up to 3 dimensions),
and both bounded and unbounded temporal values. Both single and ranged values are supported on all axes. GeoWaveâ€™s
geospatial support is built on top of the GeoTools extensibility model. This means that it can integrate natively with
any GeoTools compatible project (such as GeoServer and UDig), and can ingest GeoTools compatible data sources. GeoWave provides out-of-the-box
support for the https://accumulo.apache.org[Apache Accumulo^] and https://hbase.apache.org[Apache HBase^] distributed key/value stores.

GeoWave Features:

* Adds multi-dimensional indexing capability to Apache Accumulo and Apache HBase
* Adds support for geographic objects and geospatial operators to Apache Accumulo and Apache HBase
* Provides a http://geoserver.org/[GeoServer^] plugin to allow geospatial data in Accumulo to be shared and visualized via OGC standard services
* Provides Map-Reduce input and output formats for distributed processing and analysis of geospatial data

GeoWave attempts to do for Accumulo and HBase as PostGIS does for PostgreSQL.

=== Origin

GeoWave was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with
http://www.radiantblue.com/[RadiantBlue Technologies^] and http://www.boozallen.com/[Booz Allen Hamilton^]. The government
has https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/NOTICE[unlimited rights^] and is releasing this software to
increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.
The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache 2.0^] license.

=== Intent

==== Pluggable Backend
GeoWave is intended to be a multidimensional indexing layer that can be added on top of any sorted key-value store.
Accumulo was chosen as the initial target architecture and support for HBase has been added as well. Any datastore 
which allows prefix based range scans should be straightforward extensions.

==== Modular Design

The architecture itself is designed to be extremely extensible with most of the functionality units defined by
interfaces, and with default implementations of these interfaces to cover most use cases. The intent is that the out of the
box functionality should satisfy 90% of use cases but the modular architecture allows
for easy feature extension as well as integration into other platforms.

==== Self-Describing Data

GeoWave stores the information needed to manipulate data (such as configuration and format), in the database
itself. This allows software to programmatically interrogate all the data stored in a single or set of GeoWave instances
without needing bits of configuration from clients, application servers, or other external stores.
