== Installation from RPM

=== Overview

There is a public http://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/packages.html[GeoWave RPM Repo] available with the following packages.
As you'll need to coordinate a restart of Accumulo to pick up changes to the GeoWave iterator classes the repos default to
be disabled so you can keep auto updates enabled. When ready to do an update simply add `--enablerepo=geowave` to your
command. The packages are built for a number of different hadoop distributions (Cloudera, Hortonworks and Apache) the RPMs
have the vendor name embedded as the second portion of the rpm name (geowave-apache-accumulo, geowave-hdp2-accumulo, 
geowave-cdh5-accumulo, geowave-apache-hbase, etc.)

=== Examples

[source, bash]
----
# Use GeoWave repo RPM to configure a host and search for GeoWave RPMs to install
# Several of the rpms (accumulo, jetty and tools) are both GeoWave version and vendor version specific
# In the examples below the rpm name geowave-$VERSION-VENDOR_VERSION would be adjusted as needed
rpm -Uvh http://s3.amazonaws.com/geowave-rpms/release/noarch/geowave-repo-1.0-3.noarch.rpm
yum --enablerepo=geowave search geowave-0.9.3-apache

# Install GeoWave Accumulo iterator on a host (probably a namenode)
yum --enablerepo=geowave install geowave-0.9.3-apache-accumulo

# Update
yum --enablerepo=geowave install geowave-0.9.3-apache-*

=== RPM Installation Notes

RPM names contain the version in the name so support concurrent installations of multiple GeoWave and/or vendor versions.
A versioned /usr/local/geowave-$GEOWAVE_VERSION-$VENDOR_VERSION directory is linked to /usr/local/geowave using alternatives
ex: /usr/local/geowave -> /usr/local/geowave-0.9.3-hdp2 but there could also be another /usr/local/geowave-0.9.2.1-cdh5 still
installed but not the current default.

==== View geowave-home installed and default using alternatives

[source, bash]
----
alternatives --display geowave-home
geowave-home - status is auto.
 link currently points to /usr/local/geowave-0.9.3-hdp2
/usr/local/geowave-0.9.3-hdp2 - priority 90
/usr/local/geowave-0.9.2.1-cdh5 - priority 89
Current `best' version is /usr/local/geowave-0.9.3-hdp2.

geowave-*-accumulo: This RPM will install the GeoWave Accumulo iterator into the local file system and then upload
it into HDFS using the `hadoop fs -put` command. This means of deployment requires that the RPM is installed on a node that
has the correct binaries and configuration in place to push files to HDFS, like your namenode. We also need to set the ownership
and permissions correctly within HDFS and as such need to execute the script as a user that has superuser permissions in HDFS.
This user varies by Hadoop distribution vendor. If the Accumulo RPM installation fails, check the install log located at
`/usr/local/geowave/accumulo/geowave-to-hdfs.log` for errors. The script can be re-run manually if there was a problem that
can be corrected like the HDFS service was not started. If a non-default user was used to install Hadoop you can specify a user
that has permissions to upload with the --user argument `/usr/local/geowave/accumulo/deploy-to-geowave-to-hdfs.sh --user my-hadoop-user`

[NOTE]
====
This only applies to the Accumulo RPM. There is no such requirement for the HBase RPM.
====

With the exception of the Accumulo RPM mentioned above there are no restrictions on where you install RPMs. You can install
the rest of the RPMs all on a single node for development use or a mix of nodes depending on your cluster configuration.
