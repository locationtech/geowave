[[ingest-kafkaToGW-synopsis]]

[[ingest-kafkaToGW-description]]
==== DESCRIPTION

This command ingests data from a Kafka topic into GeoWave.

[[ingest-kafkaToGW-options]]
==== OPTIONS

*--bootstrapServers* _<brokers>_::
  This is for bootstrapping and the producer will only use it for getting metadata (topics, partitions and replicas). The socket connections for sending the actual data will be established based on the broker information returned in the metadata. The format is `host1:port1,host2:port2`, and the list can be a subset of brokers or a VIP pointing to a subset of brokers.

*--autoOffsetReset* _<offset>_::
  What to do when there is no initial offset in ZooKeeper or if an offset is out of range. If `earliest` is used, automatically reset the offset to the smallest offset.  If `latest` is used, automatically reset the offset to the largest offset. If `none` is used, don't reset the offset. Otherwise, throw an exception to the consumer.

*--batchSize* _<size>_::
  The data will automatically flush after this number of entries.  Default is 10,000.

*--consumerTimeoutMs* _<timeout>_::
  By default, this value is -1 and a consumer blocks indefinitely if no new message is available for consumption. By setting the value to a positive integer, a timeout exception is thrown to the consumer if no message is available for consumption after the specified timeout value.

*--maxPartitionFetchBytes* _<bytes>_::
  The number of bytes of messages to attempt to fetch for each topic-partition in each fetch request. These bytes will be read into memory for each partition, so this helps control the memory used by the consumer. The fetch request size must be at least as large as the maximum message size the server allows or else it is possible for the producer to send messages larger than the consumer can fetch.

*--groupId* _<id>_::
  A string that uniquely identifies the group of consumer processes to which this consumer belongs. By setting the same group id multiple processes indicate that they are all part of the same consumer group.

*$$*$$ --kafkaprops* _<file>_::
  Properties file containing Kafka properties.

*--reconnectOnTimeout*::
  If specified, when the consumer timeout occurs (based on the kafka property `consumer.timeout.ms`), a flush will occur and immediately reconnect.

*-x, --extension* _<extensions>_::
  Individual or comma-delimited set of file extensions to accept.

*-f, --formats* _<formats>_::
  Explicitly set the ingest formats by name (or multiple comma-delimited formats).  If not set, all available ingest formats will be used.

*-v, --visibility* _<visibility>_::
  The visibility of the data ingested.  Default is `public`.

When the `avro` format is used, additional options are:

*--avro.avro*::
  If specified, indicates that the operation should use Avro feature serialization.

*--avro.cql* _<filter>_::
  An optional CQL filter. If specified, only data matching the filter will be ingested.

*--avro.typename* _<types>_::
  A comma-delimitted set of type names to ingest, feature types matching the specified type names will be ingested.  By default, all type names will be ingested.

*--avro.maxVertices* _<count>_::
  Maximum number of vertices to allow for the feature. Features with over this vertice count will be discarded.

*--avro.minSimpVertices* _<count>_::
  Minimum vertex count to qualify for geometry simplification.

*--avro.tolerance* _<tolerance>_::
  Maximum error tolerance in geometry simplification. Should range from 0.0 to 1.0 (i.e. .1 = 10%).  Default is 0.02.

  A flag to indicate whether extended data format should be used.

*--gdelt.typename* _<types>_::
  A comma-delimitted set of type names to ingest, feature types matching the specified type names will be ingested.  By default all types will be ingested.

*--gdelt.maxVertices* _<count>_::
  Maximum number of vertices to allow for the feature. Features with over this vertice count will be discarded.

*--gdelt.minSimpVertices* _<count>_::
  Minimum vertex count to qualify for geometry simplification.

*--gdelt.tolerance* _<tolerance>_::
  Maximum error tolerance in geometry simplification. Should range from 0.0 to 1.0 (i.e. .1 = 10%).  Default is 0.02.

When the `geolife` format is used, additional options are:

*--geolife.avro*::
  A flag to indicate whether Avro feature serialization should be used.

*--geolife.cql* _<filter>_::
  A CQL filter, only data matching this filter will be ingested.

*--geolife.typename* _<types>_::
  A comma-delimitted set of type names to ingest, feature types matching the specified typen ames will be ingested.  By default all types will be ingested.

*--geolife.maxVertices* _<count>_::
  Maximum number of vertices to allow for the feature. Features with over this vertice count will be discarded.

*--geolife.minSimpVertices* _<count>_::
  Minimum vertex count to qualify for geometry simplification.

*--geolife.tolerance* _<tolerance>_::
  Maximum error tolerance in geometry simplification. Should range from 0.0 to 1.0 (i.e. .1 = 10%).  Default is 0.02.

When the `geotools-raster` format is used, additional options are:

*--geotools-raster.coverage* _<name>_::
  Coverage name for the raster.  Default is the name of the file.

*--geotools-raster.crs* _<crs>_::
  A CRS override for the provided raster file.

*--geotools-raster.histogram*::
  If specified, build a histogram of samples per band on ingest for performing band equalization.

*--geotools-raster.mergeStrategy* _<strategy>_::
  The tile merge strategy to use for mosaic. Specifying `no-data` will mosaic the most recent tile over the previous tiles, except where there are no data values.  By default `none` is used.

*--geotools-raster.nodata* _<value>_::
  Optional parameter to set `no data` values, if 1 value is giving it is applied for each band, if multiple are given then the first `totalNoDataValues`/`totalBands` are applied to the first band and so on, so each band can have multiple differing `no data` values if needed.

*--geotools-raster.pyramid*::
  If specified, build an image pyramid on ingest for quick reduced resolution query.

*--geotools-raster.separateBands*::
