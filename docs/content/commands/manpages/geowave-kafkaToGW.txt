NAME
//:----

geowave ingest kafkaToGW - Subscribe to a Kafka topic and ingest into GeoWave

SYNOPSIS
//:--------

geowave ingest kafkaToGW [options] <store name> <comma delimited index/group list>

DESCRIPTION
//:-----------

The geowave ingest kafkaToGW operator will ingest supported files that already exist in HDFS

OPTIONS
//:-------

- --autoOffsetReset
 * What to do when there is no initial offset in ZooKeeper or if an offset is out of range:
  ** smallest : automatically reset the offset to the smallest offset
  ** largest : automatically reset the offset to the largest offset
  ** anything else: throw exception to the consumer

- --batchSize
 * The data will automatically flush after this number of entries
 * Default is 10000

- --consumerTimeoutMs
 * By default, this value is -1 and a consumer blocks indefinitely if no new
   message is available for consumption. By setting the value to a positive integer,
   a timeout exception is thrown to the consumer if no message is available
   for consumption after the specified timeout value.

- -x, --extension
 * individual or comma-delimited set of file extensions to accept

- --fetchMessageMaxBytes
 * The number of bytes of messages to attempt to fetch for each
   topic-partition in each fetch request. These bytes will be read into memory for each
   partition, so this helps control the memory used by the consumer. The fetch request
   size must be at least as large as the maximum message size the server allows
   or else it is possible for the producer to send messages larger than the
   consumer can fetch.

- -f, --formats
 * Explicitly set the ingest formats by name (or multiple comma-delimited
   formats), if not set all available ingest formats will be used

- --groupId
 * A string that uniquely identifies the group of consumer processes to
   which this consumer belongs. By setting the same group id multiple processes
   indicate that they are all part of the same consumer group.

- *--kafkaprops
 * Properties file containing Kafka properties

- --reconnectOnTimeout
 * This flag will flush when the consumer timeout occurs (based on kafka
   property 'consumer.timeout.ms') and immediately reconnect
   Default: false

- -v, --visibility
 * The visibility of the data ingested
 * Default is 'public'

- --zookeeperConnect
 * Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form hostname:port where
   host and port are the host and port of a ZooKeeper server. To allow connecting
   through other ZooKeeper nodes when that ZooKeeper machine is down you can also
   specify multiple hosts in the form
   hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3.
