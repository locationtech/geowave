NAME

geowave ingest localToKafka - Stage supported files in local file system to a Kafka topic

SYNOPSIS
//:--------

geowave ingest localToKafka [options] <file or directory>

DESCRIPTION
//:-----------

The geowave ingest localToKafka operator will stage supported files in the local file system to a Kafka topic

OPTIONS
//:-------

- -x, --extension
 * individual or comma-delimited set of file extensions to accept

- -f, --formats
 * Explicitly set the ingest formats by name (or multiple comma-delimited
   formats), if not set all available ingest formats will be used

- *--kafkaprops
 * Properties file containing Kafka properties

- --metadataBrokerList
 * This is for bootstrapping and the producer will only use it for getting
   metadata (topics, partitions and replicas). The socket connections for sending the
   actual data will be established based on the broker information returned in the
   metadata. The format is host1:port1,host2:port2, and the list can be a subset of
   brokers or a VIP pointing to a subset of brokers.

- --producerType
 * This parameter specifies whether the messages are sent asynchronously in
   a background thread. Valid values are (1) async for asynchronous send and
   (2) sync for synchronous send. By setting the producer to async we allow
   batching together of requests (which is great for throughput) but open the
   possibility of a failure of the client machine dropping unsent data.

- --requestRequiredAcks
 * This value controls when a produce request is considered completed.
   Specifically, how many other brokers must have committed the data to their log and
   acknowledged this to the leader?

- --retryBackoffMs
* The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed produce
   request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeated sending-and-failing in a
   tight loop.

- --serializerClass
 * The serializer class for messages. The default encoder takes a byte[] and
   returns the same byte[].
