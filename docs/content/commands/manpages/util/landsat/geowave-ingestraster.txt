==== NAME

geowave-util-landsat-ingestraster - Ingest Landsat 8 imagery into a GeoWave data store

[[util-landsat-ingestraster-synopsis]]
==== SYNOPSIS

  geowave util landsat ingestraster [options] <store name> <comma delimited index list>

[[util-landsat-ingestraster-description]]
==== DESCRIPTION

This command downloads Landsat 8 imagery and then ingests it as raster data into GeoWave.

[[util-landsat-ingestraster-options]]
==== OPTIONS

*--converter* _<converter>_::
  Prior to ingesting an image, this converter will be used to massage the data. The default is not to convert the data.

*--coverage* _<name>_::
  The name to give to each unique coverage. Freemarker templating can be used for variable substitution based on the same attributes used for filtering. The default coverage name is `${productId}_${band}`.  If `${band}` is unused in the coverage name, all bands will be merged together into the same coverage.

*--cql* _<filter>_::
  An optional CQL expression to filter the ingested imagery. The feature type for the expression has the following attributes: `shape` (Geometry), `acquisitionDate` (Date), `cloudCover` (double), `processingLevel` (String), `path` (int), `row` (int) and the feature ID is `productId` for the scene. Additionally attributes of the individuals band can be used such as `band` (String), `sizeMB` (double), and `bandDownloadUrl` (String).

*--crop*::
  If specified, use the spatial constraint provided in CQL to crop the image.  If no spatial constraint is provided, this will not have an effect.

*--histogram*::
  If specified, store the histogram of the values of the coverage so that histogram equalization will be performed.

*--nbestbands* _<count>_::
  An option to identify and only use a set number of bands with the best cloud cover.

*--nbestperspatial*::
  A flag that when applied with `--nbestscenes` or `--nbestbands` will aggregate scenes and/or bands by path/row.

*--nbestscenes* _<count>_::
  An option to identify and only use a set number of scenes with the best cloud cover.

*--overwrite*::
  If specified, overwrite images that are ingested in the local workspace directory. By default it will keep an existing image rather than downloading it again.

*--pyramid*::
  If specified, store an image pyramid for the coverage.

*--retainimages*::
  If specified, keep the images that are ingested in the local workspace directory. By default it will delete the local file after it is ingested successfully.

*--sincelastrun*::
  If specified, check the scenes list from the workspace and if it exists, only ingest data since the last scene.

*--skipMerge*::
  By default the ingest will automerge overlapping tiles as a post-processing optimization step for efficient retrieval, but this option will skip the merge process.

*--subsample* _<factor>_::
  Subsample the image prior to ingest by the scale factor provided. The scale factor should be an integer value greater than or equal to 1.  Default is 1.

*--tilesize* _<size>_::
  The pixel size for each tile stored in GeoWave.  Default is 512.

*--usecachedscenes*::
  If specified, run against the existing scenes catalog in the workspace directory if it exists.

*-ws, --workspaceDir* _<path>_::
  A local directory to write temporary files needed for landsat 8 ingest.  Default is `landsat8`.

==== EXAMPLES

Ingest and crop the B8 band of Landsat raster data over a bounding box that roughly surrounds Berlin, Germany, and output raster data to a `landsatraster` data store:

  geowave util landsat ingestraster --nbestperspatial --nbestscenes 1 --usecachedscenes --cql "BBOX(shape,13.0535,52.3303,13.7262,52.6675) AND band='B8' AND cloudCover>0" --crop --retainimages -ws ./landsat --pyramid --coverage berlin_mosaic landsatraster spatial-idx
