==== NAME

geowave-util-landsat-ingest - Ingest Landsat 8 imagery and metadata into a GeoWave data store

[[util-landsat-ingest-synopsis]]
==== SYNOPSIS

  geowave util landsat ingest [options] <store name> <comma delimited index list>

[[util-landsat-ingest-description]]
==== DESCRIPTION

This command downloads Landsat 8 imagery and then ingests it as raster data into GeoWave. At the same time, it ingests the scene metadata as vector data.  The raster and vector data can be ingested into two separate data stores, if desired.

[[util-landsat-ingest-options]]
==== OPTIONS

*--converter* _<converter>_::
  Prior to ingesting an image, this converter will be used to massage the data. The default is not to convert the data.

*--coverage* _<name>_::
  The name to give to each unique coverage. Freemarker templating can be used for variable substition based on the same attributes used for filtering. The default coverage name is `${productId}_${band}`.  If `${band}` is unused in the coverage name, all bands will be merged together into the same coverage.

*--cql* _<filter>_::
  An optional CQL expression to filter the ingested imagery. The feature type for the expression has the following attributes: `shape` (Geometry), `acquisitionDate` (Date), `cloudCover` (double), `processingLevel` (String), `path` (int), `row` (int) and the feature ID is `productId` for the scene. Additionally attributes of the individuals band can be used such as `band` (String), `sizeMB` (double), and `bandDownloadUrl` (String).

*--crop*::
  If specified, use the spatial constraint provided in CQL to crop the image.  If no spatial constraint is provided, this will not have an effect.

*--histogram*::
  If specified, store the histogram of the values of the coverage so that histogram equalization will be performed.

*--nbestbands* _<count>_::
  An option to identify and only use a set number of bands with the best cloud cover.

*--nbestperspatial*::
  A flag that when applied with `--nbestscenes` or `--nbestbands` will aggregate scenes and/or bands by path/row.

*--nbestscenes* _<count>_::
  An option to identify and only use a set number of scenes with the best cloud cover.

*--overwrite*::
  If specified, overwrite images that are ingested in the local workspace directory. By default it will keep an existing image rather than downloading it again.

*--pyramid*::
  If specified, store an image pyramid for the coverage.

*--retainimages*::
  If specified, keep the images that are ingested in the local workspace directory. By default it will delete the local file after it is ingested successfully.

*--sincelastrun*::
  If specified, check the scenes list from the workspace and if it exists, only ingest data since the last scene.

*--skipMerge*::
  By default the ingest will automerge overlapping tiles as a post-processing optimization step for efficient retrieval, but this option will skip the merge process.

*--subsample* _<factor>_::
  Subsample the image prior to ingest by the scale factor provided. The scale factor should be an integer value greater than or equal to 1.  Default is 1.

*--tilesize* _<size>_::
  The pixel size for each tile stored in GeoWave.  Default is 256.

*--usecachedscenes*::
  If specified, run against the existing scenes catalog in the workspace directory if it exists.

*--vectorindex* _<index>_::
  By ingesting as both vectors and rasters you may want each indexed differently. This will override the index used for vector output.

*--vectorstore* _<store name>_::
  By ingesting as both vectors and rasters you may want to ingest vector data into a different data store. This will override the data store for vector output.

*-ws, --workspaceDir* _<path>_::
  A local directory to write temporary files needed for landsat 8 ingest.  Default is `landsat8`.

==== EXAMPLES

Ingest and crop the B8 band of Landsat raster data over a bounding box that roughly surrounds Berlin, Germany, and output raster data to a `landsatraster` data store and vector data to a `landsatvector` data store:

  geowave util landsat ingest --nbestperspatial --nbestscenes 1 --usecachedscenes --cql "BBOX(shape,13.0535,52.3303,13.7262,52.6675) AND band='B8' AND cloudCover>0" --crop --retainimages -ws ./landsat --vectorstore landsatvector --pyramid --coverage berlin_mosaic landsatraster spatial-idx
