=== Helpful Commands & Flags

GeoWave supports a few extra commands that can be used for informational purposes to debug
or explore command usage.

==== Debug Flag (--debug)

Use the debug flag to increase the debug logging output by GeoWave on the console to DEBUG.  By default, it is
set to WARN.  This flag must come right after 'geowave' and before any subcommand:

[source, bash]
----
geowave --debug <command> <subcommand> <options...>
----

==== Version Flag (--version)

The version flag will output the build arguments that were used to build GeoWave, as well as
the version of the GeoWave tools jar you're using:

[source, bash]
----
geowave --version
----

==== Help Command

The help command will show arguments and their defaults.  It can be prepended to any GeoWave command.
If you use it while also specifying a sub-command and its arguments, that command's help information
will be displayed:

[source, bash]
----
geowave help <command> <subcommand>
----

==== Explain Command

The explain command will show a simplified tabular view of the arguments and their current values.
Use this to determine what values are being passed to GeoWave.  It also shows hidden parameters and
their values, if there are any.  An example would be additional Accumulo options:

[source, bash]
----
geowave explain config addstore -t accumulo
----
