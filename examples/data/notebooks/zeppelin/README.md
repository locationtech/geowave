# Zeppelin Notebook Examples

This folder contains example notebooks for Zeppelin

## GDELT Quick Start

This notebook combines steps from the GeoWave Quick Start Guide to download and ingest GDELT data, and then demonstrates various levels of integration with KMeans analytic, SparkSQL queries and GeoServer + Leaflet map output.

## GeoWave GPX Demo

This notebook demonstrates interaction with a large dataset. The GPX data is in exported Accumulo tables on S3 and will be imported (rather than ingested). It is similar to the GDELT notebook in that it has a combination of SparkSQL, KMeans and GeoServer display.

### Getting Started

In order to run these notebook examples, you'll need to have a working GeoWave installation.  
Please see the [GeoWave Quick Start Guide](http://locationtech.github.io/geowave/quickstart.html) for instructions.
