GeoWave is an open source set of software that:

* Capabilities
  * Adds multi-dimensional indexing capability to [Apache Accumulo](https://accumulo.apache.org) and [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org)
  * Adds support for geographic objects and geospatial operators to [Apache Accumulo](https://accumulo.apache.org) and [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org)
  * Provides Map-Reduce input and output formats for distributed processing and analysis of geospatial data
* Geospatial software plugins
  * [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) plugin to allow geospatial data in Accumulo to be shared and visualized via OGC standard services
  * [PDAL](http://www.pdal.io/) plugin for working with point cloud data
  * [Mapnik](http://mapnik.org/) plugin for generating map tiles and generally making good looking maps. 
  
Basically, GeoWave is working to bridge geospatial software with distributed compute systems.

## The Docs
* Check out our [GeoWave io page](http://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/) page for detailed documentation.
* A [changelog is available](http://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/changelog.html) which details the changes and features for each of our [github releases](https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/releases)

## The Software

  * Deb packages if enough people request them
* We have [Maven artifact repositories](http://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/userguide.html#maven-repositories-2) (indexes not enabled, but it works in a maven repo fragment)
  * Releases: http://geowave-maven.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/release
  * Snapshots: http://geowave-maven.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/snapshot (nightly)
* We have a [vagrant dev environment](https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave-vagrant)
* We have a development all in one RPM package: "geowave-cdh5-single-host"
* And you can always [build from source](http://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/userguide.html#installation-from-source)
  
 
## Community

* [GeoWave](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2015_Ideas) is on the project list for the [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015).
* GeoWave is currently in the process of moving to a permanent home under [LocationTech and the Eclipse Foundation](https://locationtech.org/proposals/geowave).
* Community support is available on [chat](https://gitter.im/ngageoint/geowave) and on [our mailing list](mailto:geowave-dev@locationtech.org).

## Supported versions of core libraries

We work to maintain a N and N-1 tested and supported version pace for the following core libraries.

| Geoserver | Geotools | Accumulo | Hadoop | PDAL | Mapnik | Java |
|:---------:|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|
| 2.8.x, 2.10.x | 16.x | 1.6.x, 1.7.x | 2.x | 0.9.9 |  master (pull request pending) | Java7, Java8 |

* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.x or greater is required for building
* [Java Advanced Imaging](http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/INSTALL.html) and [Java Image I/O](http://download.java.net/media/jai-imageio/builds/release/1.1/INSTALL-jai_imageio.html) should both be installed on Geoserver for GeoWave versions 0.9.2.1 and below (licensing prohibits us redistributing)
   * At the time of writing, Oracle is migrating Java projects around and these links are subject to change.  Read the INSTALL files to determine the download file name for different operating systems and architectures.  They are stored in the same directory as the INSTALL file.  Here are some common download locations.
   * Java Advanced Imaging
      * Linux ([32-bit](http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/jai-1_1_3-lib-linux-i586.tar.gz) and [64-bit](http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/jai-1_1_3-lib-linux-amd64.tar.gz))
      * Windows ([32-bit](http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586.exe))
   * Java Image I/O
      * Linux ([32-bit](http://download.java.net/media/jai-imageio/builds/release/1.1/jai_imageio-1_1-lib-linux-i586.tar.gz) and [64-bit](http://download.java.net/media/jai-imageio/builds/release/1.1/jai_imageio-1_1-lib-linux-amd64.tar.gz))
      * Windows ([32-bit](http://download.java.net/media/jai-imageio/builds/release/1.1/jai_imageio-1_1-lib-windows-i586.exe))
* See our [.travis.yml](https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/.travis.yml) file for the currently tested build matrix.
