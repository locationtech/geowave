# GeoWave's LandSat8 Commandline Utility

This module complements GeoWave commandline tools with direct access to landsat public imagery.  To use, ensure the module is on the classpath for your geowave commandline tools and then you should have `geowave util landsat` options available to you.  `analyze` and `download` are completely separate from storage within GeoWave. The ingest routines wrap download with the additional step of ingesting into GeoWave.  If you want to ingest data that you have already downloaded just use `--retainimages`.  `ingestraster` and `ingestvector` are fairly self-explanatory and `ingest` just wraps both in a single command so for all of the scenes and bands you have ingested into your grid coverage (raster) layer, you will have the vector layers of `scenes` and `bands` with associated metadata. 
For all of the commands, the scenes and bands can be filtered using a CQL expression.  The list of the scene attributes that the CQL expression can be applied towards is this: shape (Geometry), acquisitionDate (Date), cloudCover (double), processingLevel (String), path (int), row (int) and the feature ID is entityId for the scene.  Additionally attributes of the individual bands can be used such as band (String), sizeMB (double), and bandDownloadUrl (String).  Also for all commands, you can grab only the N best cloud cover scenes or bands using `--nbestscenes` or `--nbestbands` (likely want to use nbestscenes because cloud cover is the same for a scene except for some very specific use cases).  With that, you may also want to `--nbestperspatial` which is a boolean flag that will tell the operation to maintain the N best cloud cover scenes by path and row so that overlapping scenes are minimized (for example `--nbestscenes 1 --nbestperspatial` would grab the best non-overlapping cloud cover scenes matching the filter criteria which would be an excellent choice if the goal is to produce a mosaic).  Using SPI (with a class matching the `Landsat8BandConverterSpi` interface provided on the classpath), a developer can even provide the raster ingest utility with a converter which will run through custom conversion code prior to GeoWave ingest to massage the data in any way.

## Examples
Here is an example of cropping the visible bands only, best cloud cover data available over Paris (pre-computing and ingesting an image pyramid and band intensity histograms as well).  The resulting coverage name is `paris_visible` and can be added directly to geoserver as a layer (you likely want to make sure the GeoServer style is applying the red, green,and blue bands from Landsat8 to the correct RGB rendered tiles).
```
landsat ingestraster --cql "BBOX(shape,2.08679,48.658291,2.63791,49.04694) AND (band='B2') AND (band='B3') AND (band='B4')" --usecachedscenes --nbestscenes 1 --nbestperspatial --pyramid --retainimages --crop --histogram  --coverage paris_visible <my datastore> <my index> 
```
And here's an example of ingesting both the raster and associated vector (scene and band metadata) data into GeoWave for all bands, intersecting a bounding box Paris, best cloud cover available, specifically with the scene paths 198 and 199 (scenes are organized by row and path based on Landsat8 collection).  The resulting coverage name is `paris_all_bands` which can be added as a layer in GeoServer.  If you were to add this as a layer to GeoServer perhaps you create a greyscale style using the panchromatic band from Landsat8 (band 8).  Or really just choose the stylization conforming to the band combination that you like.  Also, the `bands` and `scenes` vector layer can be added to geoserver.
```
landsat ingest --cql "BBOX(shape,2.08679,48.658291,2.63791,49.04694) AND (path=198 OR path=199)" --usecachedscenes --nbestscenes 1 --nbestperspatial --pyramid --retainimages --histogram --coverage paris_all_bands <my datastore> <my index> 
```
