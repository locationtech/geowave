/**
 * A DataStore can both ingest and query data based on persisted indices and data type adapters.
 * When the data is ingested it is explicitly given an index and a data type adapter which is then
 * persisted to be used in subsequent queries. Also, implicitly statistics are maintained associated
 * with all data ingested. These statistics can be queried. Furthermore, aggregations can be applied
 * directly to the data which are similar to statistics, but are more dynamic in that any query
 * criteria can be applied as the input of the aggregation. Data stores that support server-side
 * processing will run the aggregation within the scope of iterating through the results for
 * additional efficiency.
 *
 * <p>Here is a simple snippet of pseudocode showing how a data store can be used to store and
 * retrieve your data.
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *  DataStore store = DataStoreFactory.createDataStore(<data store options>);
 * 	store.addType(<my data type>, <my index>);
 *  try(Writer writer = store.createWriter()){
 *    //write data
 *    writer.writer(<data);
 *  }
 *
 *  //this just queries everything
 *  try(CloseableIterator it = store.query(QueryBuilder.newBuilder().build())){
 *    while(it.hasNext()){
 *      //retrieve results matching query criteria and do something
 *    	it.next();
 *    }
 *  }
 * }
 * </pre>
