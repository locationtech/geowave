/**
 * A DataStore can both ingest and query data based on persisted indices and
 * data type adapters. When the data is ingested it is explicitly given an index
 * and a data type adapter which is then persisted to be used in subsequent
 * queries. Also, implicitly statistics are maintained associated with all data
 * ingested. These statistics can be queried. Furthermore, aggregations can be
 * applied directly to the data which are similar to statistics, but are more
 * dynamic in that any query criteria can be applied as the input of the
 * aggregation. Datastores that support serverside processing will run the
 * aggregation within the scope of iterating through the results for additional efficiency.
 *
 * Here is a simple snippets of pseudocode showing how a data store can be used to store and retrieve your data.
