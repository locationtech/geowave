/**
 * This interface is used by the IngestFromHdfsPlugin to implement ingestion
 * with a mapper to aggregate key value pairs and a reducer to ingest data into
 * GeoWave. The implementation will be directly persisted to the job
 * configuration and called to generate key value pairs from intermediate data
 * in the mapper and to produce GeoWaveData to be written in the reducer.
 * 
 * @param <I>
 *            data type for intermediate data
 * @param K
 *            the type for the keys to be produced by the mapper from
 *            intermediate data, this should be the concrete type that is used
 *            because through reflection it will be given as the key class for
 *            map-reduce
 * @param V
 *            the type for the values to be produced by the mapper from
 *            intermediate data, this should be the concrete type that is used
